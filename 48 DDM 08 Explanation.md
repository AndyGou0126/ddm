all right everybody this is the explanation for DDM 8 actually the nice

thing about studying a situation comedy is the beginning is sometimes confusing

and difficult but as you study the story it gets easier and easier to understand

and I'm sure you understood the situation with George and his parents

however there are many things I do want to talk about including in the first

scene the opening line it said the castanas George is giving himself a

manicure so to give himself a manicure means he's doing it directly and there

are many situations where we can do something directly like giving yourself

a haircut I do that did you know that I cut my own

hair yes I do next time maybe I'll show you a

picture giving yourself a massage oh yes I do this all the time too you can give

yourself a pedicure yep doing your toenails now if you're not giving

yourself a haircut then you're probably getting a haircut and these are pictures

of getting something done getting a manicure getting a pedicure getting a

haircut in Korea a haircut is like $11 it's 10,000 W so about

$101 um it's just too expensive that's why I cut my own hair so I don't get a

haircut anymore I give myself a haircut and of course you can get a massage you

can get your hair done believe it or not a long time ago I got my hairir done

it's pretty crazy uh getting your makeup getting your makeup done rather yep uh

ladies and I guess nowadays men get their makeup

done uh I can get your shoes fixed you can get your shoes polished that's right

but I'm from the Army so I polish my own shoes I'm giving my shoes a shine

instead of getting my shoes shined you can get your shirts pressed that's right

instead of pressed we can say get your shirts ironed and of course get your

shirts dry cleaned so that's a couple of examples

of you doing something yourself or you having something done for you or to you

now we move along in the story and the word coffee table came up and last time

I wanted you guys to talk about your living room so let's talk talk about

living room furniture together here so once again uh this is a coffee

table the coffee table is almost always in front of the couch it comes up to

about the knee it is knee high as high as your knee usually it's in the living

room of course uh this is an end table it goes at the end of a couch or next to

a chair and on the end table you usually have a lamp that's right this is a lazy

boy which is actually a brand name and the typical name is

recliner these chairs are actually very expensive and I would like one but

they're like I think they're like $1,500 that's insane I have no living

room so I do not need any living room furniture I have no couch I have no

chair I have nothing I'm really at the bottom bottom this is what we call a

stereo now in Korea they call it an oio which would be audio in English so I'm

curious in your country is it called a stereo system or an audio system you can

just say stereo or stereo system you could say audio system too this is the

home theater that's right nowadays they call it the home theater system oh yes I

don't have a television so oh we got plants plants all over the

place Ferns and Vines and flowers plants Cactus o

cacti this is a fireplace very nice this is a wood burning stove very similar to

the fireplace this is a Ben Franklin stove I like

that this is carpeting when we talk about carpeting it's usually wall to

wall from one wall to the other wall the whole thing carpeting carpeting do you

have carpeting in your house or do you have a rug this of course is a

rug in my house I have no Carpeting and no rug so it's very easy to clean uh

this is a floor lamp Okay and this is an ottoman we call that an ottoman and of

course maybe in your living room you have a

bookcase so do you have this furniture or these types of things uh in your

living room did I forget something maybe you have an expensive vase some sort of

decoration yep let me know we can talk about it during the hangout and then

George said something very interesting scissor he asked for the scissors from

his mother but he just said scissor and yes some people do say scissor instead

of scissors and it would be like pants p n TS pants

is actually from the French word pentalon

pentalon and in New York in the fashion industry they do say pant for one pair

of pants so usually we say a pair of pants but New Yorkers will say

pant it's like glasses glasses because there's to glasses we always say glasses

but some people will say glass really and let's see what else is there they

got the scissors a pair of scissors a pair of glasses a pair of pants ah a

pair of tweezers I think I have a pair of tweezers yes a pair of tweezers these

are tweezers o and I got another one

wait a pair of tongs yes for cooking so we got

tweezers why do I have tweezers you might ask why Shane why do you have

tweezers to take care of my beautiful eyebrows why do you have tongs why do I

have tongs to scratch my back yeah well anyway uh we say a pair

of tongs a pair of tweezers now how come they just say pant

or a scissor well you can think of it like

this what is a car a car is a group of thousands of Parts there are many many

parts to a car we say car so what is a scissors a

scissors is two knives that work together I think I do have the scissors

it's gone now it was dirty uh and and these two knives that work together work

as one so a scissor some people think of it as one a scissor most people scissors

scissors tweezers tongs pants glasses etc etc okay now other things that we

use to take care of our nails uh and with scissors George is

using a scissors would be the Emory board and this again is a picture of an

Emory board this is the Clippers the nail clippers they have nail clippers

they have bigger ones toenail clippers uh similar to The Emory board

would be a file this is a file a nail file of course these are your

nails cuticles this is a hang nail ah these are very painful I do not like

getting a hang nail just hangs there it's not part of the nail actually but

anyway that's what we call it a hangnail this is a

claw these are dirty nails disgusting uh and uh this person lost a

nail I hope your nails are all healthy actually they say you can see the health

of a person if you look at their nails I wonder if that's true maybe uh

well another word that came along was Stern to be Stern s t r n and when

somebody's being stern they have a very serious face there's no time for joking

they're angry but not exploding their Stern I'm not joking you better listen

to me be careful do you understand I want you to study English and I want you

to practice every day at least 30 minutes a day do you understand I'm

being stern yeah my dad was very Stern very Stern man with me uh very nice man

but with me very Stern you had to be Stern uh so he's being stern on the one

hand and then he's primping on another which is kind of funny my dad does not

primp to primp means to make pretty so for example I can use a hair wax in my

hair I should put some hair wax on just to do it nah uh ladies uh look in the

mirror and they primp their makeup little bit of lipstick yeah they

more lipstick or more stuff or eye stuff or whatever so PR pring your clothes

oh yes before I shoot my video before I shoot my video do you think I primp my

clothes do I do I pr my hair no I don't PR anything I should I'm

sorry I will I promise I will PR in the future I will primp everything from the

top of my head to my nose

hairs ah yes that looks good to my mustache M yes to my to my skin to yeah

pring with would be like this now if you have an interview if you have a first

date if you're meeting somebody important somebody that you like maybe

uh uh the ah the parents-in-law or the girlfriend's parents or the boyfriend's

parents then you will primp you're going to PR you're going to be careful and

you'll primp each other okay but George is just primping himself it's it's not a

very manly thing thing generally guys do not primp that much uh I am not a prer

but I'll be honest 20 years ago I was a little bit

of a prer before going out on Friday night I would check myself in the mirror

I'd worry about this I'd do my hair I'd be

primping yeah so that's pring primping is kind of femi but nowadays a lot of

size primp very popular to PR look at this guy total

PR and that brings us to Jello oh jell is fantastic have you had Jello it's

difficult to find Jello in Korea I've not found the actual brand Jello and I

really like Jell-O and my mother used to make me Jello-O and she would put

bananas in the Jello-O ah that was my favorite

one of my friends mothers put peaches in the Jello-O M grapes oranges so many

delicious things that can go in jello and then when we go to college we when

we make Jello-O we don't add water we add

vodka that can be a problem you if you drink Vodka it's one shot but now you

can eat vodka like jello that's dangerous do not I do not

recommend jello shots but they are quite popular uh among college students so

Jello is a very traditional Great Dessert but it's for kids children eat

Jello there was a great song or actually jingle that we used to sing and it came

from a television commercial and I found one of the ver

so check out this TV commercial for

Jello Cathy getting braces isn't the end of the world aren't you going to smile

j e L oing uh memories memories of a youth

gone

arai try and dictate that okay the next thing I want to talk about is bicker to

bicker b i c k r to bicker bicker is the same as fight the same as argue but just

with words and sometimes it can get really

loud but it's constant it's never

ending many parents will bicker all the time about something sometimes

boyfriends and girlfriends they're always fighting you guys are always

fighting well that's what they do that's their style their style is to bicker is

that a good style it seems to work for some people to bicker actually my

grandfather he loved to bicker but my grandmother she would just oh whatever

she could just ignore it other people it was very frustrating but she loved him

and he took care of her and she lik that so she didn't mind his constant

bickering he tried to bicker and she but it' be short bickering but other people

they picker all the time they're always arguing about something and George's

parents are perfect bickering parents their bickering is nonstop it's amazing

they bicker about everything when I was young I used to

bicker with my sister ah yes my sister and I of course mostly me I was the

bicker King but now that I'm older I don't bicker

anymore because there's nobody to bicker with do I bicker yeah I guess I do

bicker because I think I'm right yeah I usually think that I am right and if

somebody disagrees with me then I like to bicker not you not you you guys

you're my students I'm always nice I will not bicker with my students unless

I'm right then I might picker uh but anyway so what about you and your family

your girlfriend your boyfriend do you bicker with anybody in your vicinity is

there somebody who bickers a lot what do they bicker

about if you know that the person is a bickering person can you still have a

good relationship I think so um I would not

want to be a member of the castanza family but I would love visiting the

castanas just to see them bicker yeah when I was in high school I had a friend

Greg and his parents bickered all the time it was great fun to watch the

bickering and finally I wanted to talk about tiptop shape another great

expression so if something is in shape what does that mean I am in shape does

that mean I have a good manly shape if a woman is in shape does that mean she has

a nice female shape well no and yes okay

it can mean the physical shape of a person so a man with good shape should

have a little bit of muscle here and and good no fat down here it should be a

sixpack it should be good is George in good shape no physically he doesn't look

perfect okay uh but the other type of being in shape in good shape means to be

healthy so for me I can run a little bit and I can exercise and lift weights a

little bit so I'm I'm in shape I'm a little in shape I'm not super healthy

but I can I can play sports and still get around without being too tired but

actually I need to get into shape I need to get into shape I need to start

exercising I need to build up my cardio build up up my endurance I don't need to

lose weight I need to build a little muscle I need to get into shape so let's

say I I exercise for three months I'm doing lots of exercise and at the end of

3 months I feel great and I look good I look physically healthy you could say

wow Shane you are in tiptop shape in tiptop shape tip top condition the top

the best the tip the tip of the top the absolute best the Pinnacle the best

shape the best condition so usually it refers to your body but it can refer to

your nails oh look my nails are in tiptop shape uh it could refer to your

cell phone uh my cell phone I I updated the software and now my cell phone is in

tip top shape my computer I can tell you my computer is not in tiptop shape my

computer these days is running a little bit slow and when I make the videos it

takes a long time so my computer is not in tiptop shape what can I do I should

probably upgrade the RAM maybe I should put the system in again yeah I don't

know but my computer is not in tiptop shape so this is a great expression your

car is your car in tiptop shape so my question to

you you or around you your car your cell phone your computer something what is in

tiptop shape what is not in tiptop shape and

how can you get that to tiptop shape so it's three questions what are around you

is in tiptop shape what around you is not in tiptop shape and what can you do

to get that into tiptop shape okay so it's three questions and I want you to

think about it and try and give me an answer in the next hangout all right

well that's pretty much it uh there's not a lot of culture to talk about in

this Seinfeld episode I mean in this last Seinfeld part um but hopefully it

was much easier for you to hear the situation and understand the situation

remember practice the pronunciation that's the most important thing that's

it next month we will do another Seinfeld but after next month we will do

a different sitcom okay so we are going to continue to do sitcoms basically four

classes of a sitcom at least four classes of a sitcom and four four

classes of news or history or something different like that okay so if you have

requests please send them to me I will teach programs you want to learn and uh

I asked you guys in the last video what did you like what did you want to study

and Seinfield was popular but you gave me some other ideas too so I appreciate

that so uh this is the last explanation for the first month and thank you so

much for joining Ddm and I will see you next week April 2nd

is the next video for DDM 1 of the second month thanks a lot and I'll see

you next month

bye-bye
