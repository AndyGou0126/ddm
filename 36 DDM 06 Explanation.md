okay so let's talk about DD M6 it's not that difficult if you watch

the video uh the video pretty much explains it uh let me go over the first

line a fitness shoe called kangu is making a comeback from the 80s so that

means this shoe was popular in the the 1980s okay it was popular and then the

popularity died nobody used it but it's making a comeback Great Expression to

make a comeback do you know the singer David

Bowie he was very popular in the 1970s and he's making a comeback now

these days he's making a comeback these bouncy shoes are making a comeback from

the 80s well that's cool have you ever made a

comeback we usually use this expression for singers and movie stars people who

were very popular then they disappear and then they make a

comeback this is coach Shane I'm making my comeback after one

day now after one day doesn't really make a lot of sense yeah so anyway this

is a fitness shoe a fitness shoe Fitness means aerobics so these shoes called

Kango were popular in the 1980s by the way a lot of people want to write

80s okay actually that's wrong because this means

80 is or 80 possession okay so we're talking about

the 80s from 1980 to 1989 this is plural so therefore it

should be 80s and if you want to be grammatic then you can add your

possession okay but I'm an English guy but most people

write this it's wrong but most people write it so my recommendation write it

like me

but if you want to be like most people then you can write it like this it's up

to you take my advice or leave it whatever you want anyway once again a

fitness shoe called kangu is making a comeback from the 80s helping you

bounce jump Skip Skip to My L myling Skip to My

L myling Skip to My l here's a

video that's skipping Skip to My Skip to My L my

darling and run and of course running is like this now I do have a question

what's the difference between run and Jog to run and to jog well to run is a

little bit more serious so a runner is somebody who who is very careful about

their running schedule they like to check their time they like to check

their distance they're not worried about

weight they're already thin or thin enough

their reason for running is very personal it's it's it's competitive it's

about time and distance urance

jogging is much more leisurely you just want to go around the

block you just want to lose some weight you just want to maintain a little bit

of Health jogging 5 minutes 50 minutes whatever you don't care about the time

it's more about just getting out there and enjoying and trying to lose weight

that's the idea so if I make it easy run Runners are serious hardcore joggers are

a bit more relaxed or they're more concerned with their weight and General

Health okay so that's that's one difference there okay so

anyway so these kangoos help you bounce jump Skip and run with little impact

shock shock okay so the shock is boom Oh that's a lot of shock impact shock boom

so every time you run your knees and your feet are hitting the asphalt boom

boom boom so when you're young it's okay but as we get older the impact shock is

not good for our knees it's not good for the hips it's not good for the ankles

it's not good that impact shock is tough eyewitness news reporter Lori carbin

strapped on a pair to check out this latest Trend okay so we say strapped on

a pair of Kang Goos put on a pair of Kang Goos but if you look at these Kang

goo these shoes they look like ski boots or inline skates and if you've ever worn

inline skates or ski boots there's a strap it's not like a regular shoe so

strap on she used that verb let me read it

again a fitness shoe called kangu is making a comeback from the 8S helping

you bounce jump Skip and run with little impact shock eyewitness news reporter

Lori Corbin strapped on a pair to check out this latest

Trend you know you should mix up your workout but with work leaving you drowsy

the treadmills again on autopilot you know ah you know you

should mix up your workout your workout workout one word it's a noun do you work

out that's a verb workout my workout well yes and no I

walk I walk with my son usually every day we go on two walks

one for 5 kmet and the next for three km so we work out 8 km a day and we mix up

the workout sometimes we go this way around

the block sometimes we go this

way sometimes we go a different route sometimes we go this way sometimes

we go to another area so we mix up the workout we change the workout this way

lots of hills this way very straight so sometimes there's Hills sometimes it's

straight this is by the river so there's lots of wind usually in One Direction

but this is in the woods in the woods in the forest so there's no wind so we mix

up the workout what if you go to the health club you're always doing your

chest oh yeah oh and eventually you have big breasts and really small arms and

nothing else no you need to mix it up you got to do your chest one day your

shoulders another day your triceps your B you got to mix it up you got to do

everything your legs you got to mix it up otherwise you walk around like

popey and then your your legs look really stupid really like

toothpicks that's kind of funny so you know you know you should mix up your

workout but with work leaving you drowsy after

you're done working all day studying all day do you want to

exercise many people are too tired oh I'm tired I want to go home and eat and

sleep watch TV I don't want to work out drowsy uh she used the word drowsy

drowsy this word is usually used when we're driving

that's not a good thing drowsy driving is so dangerous be careful if you feel

drowsy stop stop the car sleep walk around seriously it's not a

joke sometimes when you're in school the teacher is

talking maybe right now you're watching my video are you feeling Dr

hey wake up at church you go to church as soon as you sit

down you start to feel drowsy so feeling drowsy is when sleep starts coming to

you so after work you're feeling drowsy you don't want to work out the treadmill

is once again on autopilot so the treadmill is the running machine is once

again on autopilot what does that mean the treadmill is is operating with no

effort that means you go to the gym you know you should change your workout but

without thinking you get on the treadmill you turn on the television and

you walk for one hour and then you're done without thinking you don't even

know what you're doing is that a workout not really it's not really a workout but

not today welcome to kangu jump a class that can't help but put a smile on your

face if something can't help but put a smile on your face it has to put a smile

on your face so when you walk into this health club and you see the Kango jump

class you see 30 40 people doing this with weird shoes you

smile what the heck is that that looks stupid

I want to do it too let let me try so this is the idea you can't help

but smile you can't help but smile um if you uh let's say you have a

at at the University you have a really boring professor and as soon as you go

into the classroom you can't help but sleep you can't help but sleep

if you're hiking even a skinny guy I'm kind of skinny if you're hiking in the

mountains even if I'm hiking I can't help but sweat I sweat I sweat a little

bit I can't help it I must sweat sweat comes out you can't stop it can't help

but great expression let's read this

again you know you should mix up your workout but with work leaving you drowsy

the treadmills again on autopilot but not today welcome to kangu jum a

class that can't help but put a smile on your

face actually you know I'm a big kid okay the kid inside of me now plays on

the hopp shoes so this is a kangu jump instructor

like an aerobics teacher he teaches the workout okay so he says actually you

know I'm a big kid inside I'm a big kid outside I'm an old man I'm a scary old

man but inside I'm a kid yay okay the kid inside of me now plays

on Hoppity shoes and Hoppity just is the sound for hopping jumping hippity

hoppity hippity hoppity Easter's on its way hippity hoppity hippity hoppity oh

it sounds fun it's a good word workout his name was Robert De

deara Robert deara says snap man try them out snap them we know the

pronunciation whoa let me do some so snap I want to talk about

pronunciation snap them on try them out snap

them on whoops try them out okay and the them

pronunciation there are three possible pronunciations we can say them we can

say them and we can say um so um is actually very common get rid of all this

snap them on Snap them on try them out snap them on try them out snap them on

try them out now what does SNAP them on them the shoes the Kango shoes snap

means when you put the shoes on there's a snap there's a a snap sound

okay snap them on try them out give them a try that's

what he says it's scary at first when you first are standing on these shoes

it's scary but takes little time to get the hang of it takes little time it

takes little time to do something it just takes a little time to do something

only a little time okay it takes a little time now this is

interesting where's my black marker here we go so

it takes time to do something it

takes a little time to do something it

takes little time to so once again can you see

all this yeah it takes little time to means it's

quick you can learn fast it takes a little time to means it's a little

slow it takes time to means it is definitely slow Okay so this is

slower than this one okay so it takes little time really quickly it takes a

little time to it takes it takes a it takes a little time five minutes five

minutes it takes a little time to H 20 minutes it takes time to two

hours it could be that okay so these are a little bit different and this will

will be an English challenge coming up I think it's the next English challenge so

don't give other people the answers okay only DDM members are privilege to this

lesson and it came out in our script that's why studying real English and

real situations is so good because we can we can see how English is used and

we can talk about the little Nuance differences and expressions like this

did you know that this was different now you do okay so it uh takes little time

to get the hang of it to get the hang of it it takes little time to Quick get the

hang of it so to get the hang of something means to get used to it to

feel natural oh so inline skating inline skating have you done this this is

inline skating yeah now did it take little time to get

the hang of it not me no I'm very

uncomfortable downhill skiing down downhill skiing downhill skiing yeah did

it take little time take little time to get used to it yes for me instantaneous

really downhill skiing nothing that was easy for me inline skating no I I I

still can't it's I'm terrible so everybody's different let me

read this again actually you know I'm a big kid

okay the kid inside of me now plays on the Hoppity

shoes Robert deara says snap them on try them out it's scary at first but takes

little time to get the hang of it you have almost a 4 in width down here 4 in

is about like this about 10 cm so down here here on the shoe you've got your

shoe I'm not an artist so this is the shoe and then you've got the Kango jump

right okay well he's talking about the width of this the width of this is about

4 in oh that's that's about like your

foot that's wide that's not too skinny it's not like ice skates ice skates have

the inch of a hair ice skates wo that's difficult inline skates well that's too

difficult but this is 4 inches okay so you have almost a 4 in width down here

so the balance is really not an issue balance is not a problem okay so balance

it's easy to 4 Ines 4 in is easy to balance it's like ice

skates okay but 4 in that's easy that's easy it's not an

issue balance is not an issue at first when you get on it it's like doing

anything else your body needs to adjust so the first time when you get on these

shoes your body whoa whoa it needs to adjust it needs to slowly get used to it

to feel comfortable with it ways of about 3.4 lb each so the

shoes weigh about 3.4 lb each that's a lot that's kind of

heavy it's a lot of fun it's great fun low impact remember running was a lot of

impact impact shock this is low impact it also Burns 20% more calories so

regular running or regular aerobics this burn earns 20% more calories wow that

sounds pretty good you have almost a 4in width down

here so the balance is really not an issue at first when you get on it it's

like doing anything else your body needs to adjust weighs about 3.4 lbs each um

it's a lot of fun low impact it also Burns 20% more

calories introduced in the 880s Kangoo jumps were

designed mainly for runners with injuries okay that's we can understand

that so Runners with injuries they they hurt their hips or their knees or their

ankles but Runners are serious people so they still want to train so these shoes

were designed for runners all right but with huge shock absorbing

shells those who used to perform Impact Sports can now work out with little

stress so people who used to a long time ago perform do Impact Sports Impact

Sports are running so I used to be a runner oh I loved running but oh I

injured myself or after 20 years of running my knees hurt ah I can't run

anymore it hurts but now thanks to Kango jumps I can I can do it again I can have

the feeling of running again I can do this because it's low impact because of

the shock absorbing the shock absorbing so it's it's low impact and it feels

nice there's no no impact at all to the knee joints ankle joints um core

stabilization is improved core strength so once again the trainer comes out and

he says there's no impact at all there's no shock at all to the knee joints to

the ankle joints that's great core stabilization is improved core means

your inside your inside especially your abdomen this area this is your core core

stabilization your body can control its balance you build the muscles again

inside your body not just the legs but the whole inside of your body You're

Building balance and core strength you're building the strength so this is

really good if you are a runner or a cyclist you know

your abdomen your stomach is pretty strong

okay because you can do this and still run no problem but if you're not a

runner you don't have good Core Balance and if you're fat you don't have

good core strength but this these Kango jumps

improve the core stabilization The Core Balance and the core strength let me

read that again introduced in the 80s Kango jumps

were designed mainly for runners with injuries but with huge shock absorbing

shells those who used to perform Impact Sports can now work out with little

stress there's no impact at all to the knee joints ankle joints um core

stabilization is improving improved core strength De La Riva developed a hip

injury teaching spinning a non-impact sport yet this training actually helps

him heal so this trainer he used to teach spinning and spinning is a

stationary bike exercise check your glossery everybody's on a stationary

bike and it's a type of exercise but he used to teach this however he

developed a hip injury and the hip is actually the side not the butt I'm not

showing you my butt the side okay the hip the hip joint he developed a hip

joint oh it was very painful so he couldn't teach spinning classes so

delara developed a hip injury teaching spinning now spinning is a non-impact

sport but still he developed the injury yet this training however

this kangu jump training actually helps him heal this training is helping his

hips get stronger amazing deor reiva says I can I can do everything

vertical and there's none of that pain from that none of that impact so it's

pretty cool I mean I can do a lot more cardio now so this guy he's excited that

now he can do his exercise vertically up and down he can

do his exercise vertical and there's no impact usually if we do it vertical oh

it's bad for the knees it's bad for the ankles but there's no impact it's very

very nice so it's pretty cool he likes it I mean I can do a lot more cardio now

cardio refers to cardiovascular exercise and

cardiovascular exercise is exercise that increases your heart rate and your

breathing rate which is some people think it's really good so there's two

types of exercise there's aerobic exercise and anerobic

exercise aerobic exercise is cardio cardiovascular exercise people who run

and people who swim they're doing cardio they're doing cardio workouts cardio

vascular exercise people who lift

weights people people who Sprint people who play football American style

football that is not really cardio that is Anor robic exercise anob exercise

okay so cardio is supposed to be good for you that's what a lot of people say

and these shoes help anybody who has been injured do cardio workouts that's

pretty good let me read it again De La Riva developed a hip injury

teaching spinning a non-impact sport yet this training actually helps him

heal I can do everything vertical and there's none of that pain from that none

of that impact so it's pretty cool I mean I can do a lot more cardio

now okay this is a whole lot of fun which means means you're probably going

to work out more that gives you the opportunity to get better balance more

coordination and of course burn a load of calories this is a whole lot of fun

this is great fun this exercise is fun it's actually not boring it's fun

because it's fun you will probably work out more because it's fun you'll

exercise more that's what she's saying and because you exercise more that gives

you more opportunity more chances to get better balance to improve your balance

more coordination coordination check your dictionary but coordination means

control of your body so by doing this exercise you get better balance you get

better control of your body and of course burn a load of calories burn a

ton of calories you can burn a lot of calories which means you will lose

weight that's really good I like the expression burn a load of calories why

do we say a load let me explain do you guys know what a dump truck is this is a

a truck oh boy I am not an artist this is a truck

and this is a dump truck and inside here you can put inside

the dump truck you can put stone or

dirt or whatever and then uh they can they can lift the top like this and they

can dump out the stone into that's a dump

truck okay so this dump truck what where's my markers where are are my

markers here we go what goes in here what goes in there stone or dirt how

much Stone how much dirt one load one load so the amount that goes in here

is one load is this a large amount yes it's a large amount so a load of

calories means a large amount of calories

I ate a load of pizza last night that means I ate a lot of pizza today you are

studying a load of English you are studying a lot of English okay it's a

great expression let me read this again okay this is a lot of fun which

means you're probably going to work out more that gives you the opportunity to

get better balance more coordination and of course burn a load of

calories actually Larry Nelson became a distributor after losing 30 lbs using

kangaroo jumps now grammatically this sentence

doesn't need the word actually I'm guessing the reporter was editing her

video and she forgot the word actually we we let's get rid of actually and

start with Larry Nelson this big guy Larry Nelson

became a distributor of kangu jumps after losing

30 lbs so this guy Larry starts using kangu jumps and wow like magic he loses

30 PBS that's really good but he's so excited he says this is my business and

he starts selling Kango jumps he he's a distributor he sells Kango jumps because

it worked for him if something works for you you can become a good salesman okay

let me read it again actually Larry Nelson became a distributor after losing

30 pounds using Kango jumps now Larry says I started this I

was about 340 345 um that was a year ago I'm down to

I'm down to about 312 as of today so he's talking about his weight 340

345 oh my God that's huge that's like 150

kilogram that's a pig that's huge well I guess if you're really tall it's okay

but for me I'm 178 cm and if I weighed 150 kg i' I'd fill up the camera ohello

yeah that's not healthy that's too big it's too big so he was 340 345 when he

started pounds these are pounds not kilograms and after a couple months he's

now down to 312 he lost about 40 lbs that's great as

of today as of today I checked the scale and I am 312 yay he's losing weight

congratulations to him how did he lose weight because of Kango jumps because of

that he's so excited he's selling Kango jumps one more

time I started this I was about 340 345 um that was a year ago I'm down to

about 312 as of today running about three or four days a

week in Kangoo what is the reporter talking

about she's going back to Larry so he lost 40

lbs and he didn't run every day only three maybe four days a week so that's

great you don't have to exercise every day just three or 4 days a

week and the only pain you might feel is in your wallet now remember kangu jumps

these shoes are low impact shock absorbing no pain

but she says you might feel maybe just a little you might feel a little pain

where in your wallet in your wallet now in your

wallet that's where you keep money so to feel pain in your

wallet they must be expensive you you have to pay a lot of money let's

continue and the only pain you might feel is in your wallet as a pair costs

about 200 bucks wow $200 for a pair of Kangoo jumps yes

that's for me that's painful that's a little expensive a little bit painful

thank God I'm not 350 lbs but like spinning shoes surf or

skate skateboards take care and they'll last for years yes it's expensive but

like spinning shoes your cycling shoes or

surfboards or skateboards those are expensive if you take care of them they

will last for years so if you buy Kango jumps they're expensive but if you take

care of them they will last for years you can use them for years and that's it

let me read it one more time running about 3 or 4 days a week in

Kangoo and the only pain you might feel is in your wallet as a pair costs about

200 bucks but like spinning shoes surf or skateboards take care and they'll

last for years so that's DDM 6 it's about

exercise specifically aerobic exercise cardio cardiovascular

exercise and the focus of this was low impact exercise shock absorbing shoes

kangu jumps it's an easy story did you
