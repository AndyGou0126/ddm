hello everybody now I will explain DDM to let's take a look at the first

sentence I'm an artist based in New York and I'm working on a project called the

Bay of Lights which is consists of a light sculpture which is just under

25,000 White LED lights which we're attaching to the suspender cables of the

Bay Bridge that is a long sentence so

basically he's introducing himself he's an artist he is based in New York that

means his home is in New York his art studio is in New York and usually when

we say New York we we mean New York City so he's based in New York City but right

now he's in the Bay Area and in America when we say the Bay Area we mean the San

Francisco area Okay so he's an artist based in New York and he's working on a

project called the Bay of Lights the Bay of Lights the bay refers to the area

around San Francisco the San Francisco Bay the Bay

of Lights is the name of the art project okay he calls it a sculpture he says it

consists of a light sculpture now usually when we say sculpture we think

of Michelangelo and we think of a big piece

of stone marble and he's cutting the stone into to some beautiful horse or

some other beautiful uh carving that's usually what we say when we talk about a

sculpture but actually any artwork that is threedimensional

3D can be called a sculpture so this this artwork are

lights attached to a bridge and he calls it a sculpture okay so it consists of a

light sculpture which is just under which is almost

25,000 white LED lights okay so it's lights but they're LED lights they're

not incandescent lights they're not fluorescent lights they're LED lights

and they're put on these cables all right

and he says which we are attaching to the suspender cables of the Bay Bridge

so here's the Bay Bridge and we can see the cables so on

these cables he's attaching these white LED lights and that will be his

sculpture that's pretty simple the next sentence and it's a 1.8 mile expanse of

bridge between San Francisco and Treasure

Island wow this is huge in America 1.8 miles we always say miles but that's

almost 3 kilometers so the bridge is really long but he's using a section of

3 kilom which will have the lights on the

cables and this bridge is called the Bay Bridge it's not the San Francisco bridge

it's not the Golden Gate Bridge it's another Bridge the Bay Bridge and the

Bay Bridge connects connects San Francisco to Treasure Island now

Treasure Island is a interesting place Treasure Island is a manmade Island they

made it way back in the 1930 s and they made it and used it for the world fair

the world fair in 1939 and 1940 a very exciting event after the

world fair the military used the land especially during World War II the Navy

used the land a lot and uh eventually the Navy sold the land back to the city

actually they exchanged the land uh to the city

and the the there's a problem though when the military used the land the land

actually became polluted very dirty land so it was almost useless land so

nowadays they're still cleaning the land and people are moving to Treasure Island

and they're living there there are some hous

in the area and it's also very popular for tourists and if you go to Treasure

Island the view of San Francisco is spectacular a lot of pictures of the

city of San Francisco are taken from Treasure Island okay so this is the Bay

Bridge it connects San Francisco to Treasure Island and that is the bridge

this artist is using for his sculpture okay it's highlighting a part of the

bridge of this incredible piece of infrastructure that's so meaningful to

many people here in the Bay Area so to highlight something means to put the

spotlight on something right now I will highlight my bald

spot ah yes Shane highlighted his bald spot how did I highlight my bald spot by

pointing to it but he is highlighting this bridge how is he highlighting it by

putting lights on the cables that's how he is highlighting it and this bridge is

so meaningful it's very important to the people of San

Francisco this bridge is almost three times big busier than the Golden Gate

Bridge it's a very busy Bridge so this bridge is very important every day

people are crossing the bridge everybody sees the bridge and now we will see the

bridge as a beautiful sculpture interesting by the way the Bay Bridge

and the Golden Gate Bridge were built about the same time but the Golden Gate

Bridge is a a little bit longer than the Bay

Bridge but it's bringing art light technology into the

mix this artwork is including art light and technology so overall it's art it's

an artistic piece but there's a lot of Technology there's a lot of computer

programming computer programming to manage the lights so usually do we think

of light as artwork no we think of colors usually but this

man is taking this infrastructure this bridge and putting light into it and

using computer technology to make an amazing art work okay so to bring

something in the mix into the mix means to combine several things so

DDM brings several things into the mix DDM brings pronunciation into the mix it

brings listening skills into the mix it brings vocabulary into the mix and it

brings speaking into the mix so I'm bringing speaking vocabulary listening

and pronunciation into the mix into the DDM mix the

DDM whole project the whole program I'm

combining all of those things okay it's a good expression to bring a b and c

into the mix and the other thing you know is that

it's site specific it's made specifically for this

location this is an easy sentence this design this artwork cannot be used on

other Bridges it can't be used in other places it's designed only for this

bridge so I've been sitting out here for over a month working on the sequencing

and the programs and fine-tuning it so if you watch the video you see the

man sitting outside on his computer and he's trying to sequence the lights

trying to make a nice order you don't want just chaos you want patterns you

want nice patterns so he's sequencing the patterns he's putting these patterns

in order he's working on the computer program to sequence these patterns okay

and he's fine tuning it now we learned fine-tune an ebed to fine tune something

means to make it better to make it perfect so I have a resume and it looks

good but if I changed the font it might look better that would be

fine tuning if I made my name a little bigger that might be better that's the

idea of fine tuning when we listen to a radio we have to tune the radio in into

a frequency 98.7 but if it's

98.6 it's not clear so we need to F tune it to adjust something just a little bit

that is fine tuning it's a great expression but this is an abstract

artwork it's not a light show it's something kind of new in that it's using

very new material software and LEDs when we talk about abstract art The

Perfect Image would be Picasso Picasso I can draw Picasso this

is my

Picasso yeah this is a person no I'm sorry I'm sorry sorry P

now actually Picasso he had a great understanding of

painting and he could make beautiful paintings and then he started to do
------------------------------
abstract art so what is abstract art it's something that if we just look at

it we don't really understand it we have to think about it and we have to

concentrate on it it's not typical it's atypical it's very hard to understand

and this artwork is abstract art okay maybe it's abstract art it's not a light

show okay when we say a light show usually that means lasers and colorful

lights and music and it's kind of a dancing atmosphere this is not a light

show it's not a light show it's something kind kind of new it's a new

type of show it's a new type of art how is it new in that it's in that it is

using very new material so this art is new because it's using new material this

artwork is new in that it's using new material what kind of material software

and led d s this software for art it's the first time we're using this kind of

software for art and it's the first time we're using

25,000 white LED lights for art it's the first time so it's new it's not a light

show people are attracted to light and I think they'll respond in whatever way

people people you and me we're attracted to light if we see light we notice it we

we maybe we go to it we're attracted to it but yes we recognize we see light and

he says I think they will people will respond in whatever way so people are

attracted to light oh look at the bridge oh wow it's beautiful another person oh

look at the bridge they're attracted to oh wow that's a waste of electricity

another person oh wow look at the bridge wow it's beautiful what does it

mean oh another person maybe a little child Oh Daddy look at the bridge oh

look at the lights it's so pretty so people are attracted to light they will

see the light and their response will be various they'll have various types of

responses some people will like it people maybe won't like it some people

will be very critical some people will be very deep and philosophical there

will be many types of reactions but people will react in many different ways

why will they react because people are attracted to

light if they know something about the history of Art light sculpture they

might be into that or technology or algorithms or you know programming so he

continues to explain if people know about the history of Art and they see my

design they'll think about the history of Art and my design they'll say wow new

history is being made if they know about light sculpture oh wow this is a unique

style of light sculpture they'll be into that they'll be excited about that

aspect they'll be interested in that part of the sculpture children they're

not interested in the history of art or the technology they're just interested

in the shapes and the designs other people uh they might be into the

technology my goodness that's amazing technology to make this

entire 3 kilometers of bridge into a light sculpture that's the technology

they might be into the algorithms the math wow the programming for such a huge

and amazing sculpture must be incredible I wonder how they made the program how

they made the algorithms and finally uh they might be

into the programming the method of programming what software did they use

what language did they use what computer did they use so people for many

different reasons will be interested so I think it will touch on a

lot of the things that are kind of key in the Bay area so I think this light

sculpture will touch on instead of touching SE we could say will involve

will include will highlight a lot of the

things that are kind of key in the Bay Area now the Bay Area the San Francisco

area has another famous name it's called Silicon Valley have you heard of Silicon

Valley that's the Bay Area all of the it companies the big it companies they are

in the Silicon Valley so there are programmers there are algorithm experts

there are it professionals there are wireless communication professionals

computer professionals everybody and my project will touch on all of those areas

will highlight all of those areas will involve all of those areas we'll include

all of those areas we'll touch on all of those areas that are really important

key important in the Bay Area in the Bay Area everybody loves technology and my

art sculpture will involve all of those people we've been testing and debugging

so everyone's been kind of watching the process for several weeks now so while

he's outside with his computer programmed the lights he's been testing

the lights and debugging problem solving

troubleshooting working out the problems he's been debugging the software the

problems so people have been walking by and they've been seeing the progress

they've been seeing the process they've been watching oh he's controlling the oh

this is it wow this is interesting so people have been watching the

preparations for the sculpture but we're launching this piece

on March 5th at 9:00 so he's been outside testing for

several weeks but the official beginning the official launch the official start

will be March 5th yes March 5th at 900 p.m. so I think

today is March 5th maybe yeah I have to look at my calendar again is it March

5th no it's actually already March 6th all right well anyway so it started off

but in America maybe about now it is actually begun it has begun right now in

America and there will be a lot of jubilation when it's finally up and

it'll be up for two years and there will be a lot of Jubilation a lot of

Happiness when this sculpture is finally up is finally done is finally presented

and opened to the world and so there'll be a lot of happiness and it'll be up

for 2 years they will keep the sculpture running they will keep the lights

operating for two years why just two years keep it going forever why

not and we're estimating 50 million people will see it so it's really uh a

really impactful piece of public art and we're estimating we're guessing

we're thinking in our opinion according to our calculations 50 million people

will see this sculpture that's a lot of people 50 million people to see the

sculpture wow that's it's a lot so it's really uh a really

impactful piece of public art this art it's public art the whole public can see

it it's not private it's public it's out in the public so this public art will

have have a huge impact people will see it and remember it and talk about it

this art will have an impact on the public cool what kind of

impact I wonder it looks nice and regarding lights lights are expensive

but LED lights are actually very inexpensive to run but uh what they do

after two years with all those lights have you been to San

Francisco San Francisco is one of America's most beautiful cities it used

to be just a really tiny fishing Village but in

1849 they discovered gold in the area and the city grew and grew and grew so

from a tiny fishing Village it became an economic Center and even today it is a

financial center especially for Northern California so

1849 was The Big Year for San Francisco San Francisco has many Hills lots and

lots of hills so their cars their train their trolleys are very famous um and

you can see a picture here so people riding these uh they use them for

Transportation but a lot of tourists really like to ride these I have never

ridden one I've been in San Francisco but I have not been on one of these

maybe one day I can the peers the docks the ocean front is very popular good

fish fish if you like uh Seafood they have great stuff there and of course if

you are an IT person information technology you probably will love San

Francisco because everybody is it if you want to start a new IT company a new

internet company you should go to San Francisco it's a fantastic City and

here's a couple extra facts San Francisco is one of the richest cities

in America they have many billionaires most of them because of the

IT industry the Golden Gate Bridge is so

long that they have over 30 full-time painters the painters paint the bridge

on the east side and then they go to the west or is it the North to the South and

then when they finish they have to start over again right away 30 full-time paint

painters paint this bridge every day of the

year cable cars are very famous in San Francisco especially with tourists this

city has many many Hills and the cable cars make getting around more convenient

and lots of fun another famous island near San Francisco is Alcatraz it used

to be a prison but it's not a prison anymore in fact you can go visit

Alcatraz and see for yourself it was supposed to be a prison where no one

could ever escape did you see the movie Alcatraz it's very

good and if you've ever used Microsoft Windows

XP the opening scene the background picture on your computer screen is taken

from San Francisco actually it's from Napa Valley which is very near San

Francisco it's a beautiful picture it's real yes it's real and Napa Valley is

also famous for wine San Francisco the Bay Area really

is a nice place to visit it's in the northern California area and especially

if you go there about now the springtime the flowers are amazing

they're really the desert flowers it really looks pretty um that's when I I

was there in the fall but I did see it in the springtime in an airplane and it

was fantastic very beautiful so if you have a chance to visit San Francisco I

highly recommend it and that's the explanation for DDM 2

I hope it was easy if you have questions ask me in the Hangouts okay

bye-bye
