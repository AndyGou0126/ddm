okay let's figure out ddm3 and the story and each sentence the

first sentence in the spring of

1939 during the buildup to war with Germany the British government

commissioned a series of propaganda posters so the year 1939 in Spring

March April May the British government was worried

about war with Germany so they're preparing for war they have a buildup

they're preparing weapons and bombs and tanks and they're preparing the public

they're talking to the public about war with Germany so to help them prepare for

war they they commissioned some posters what does it to mean to commission

something it means to pay somebody to make something usually we say

commissioned artwork so for example I open a new school and I want a big mural

a huge painting on a wall so I ask an artist hey John the artist I will pay

you money if you make a special mural a special painting for me so a

commissioned artwork A commissioned piece of music a commissioned sculpture

well in this case commissioned posters the UK government paid people to create

posters what kind of posters propaganda posters and when we say prop propaganda

posters I can think of several examples from the United States I these is uh a

very typical propaganda poster and then Russia and I don't know if these are

typical propaganda posters but this is the image and then of course uh Nazi

Germany they had propaganda posters too so propaganda posters posters that are

are used to create Unity with the people to have all the people the public the

citizens of the nation to follow the nation and believe in the nation and

become very strong Patriots that would be propaganda okay

let's go to the next sentence these posters were intended to

to offer the public reassurance in the dark days that lay

ahead so these posters were intended to do something these posters were supposed

to make the public feel relaxed to reassure to comfort the public in the

dark days that lay ahead so in UK in the UK and London all over Britain there

were dark days that lie ahead the people were worried about the future the future

was going to be dark there was going to be War so those dark days lie ahead all

right but right now it's 2013 so it's past tense so we should say

lay ahead so lie the past tense of lie is Lay this is

confusing um I do have a video on Coach Chain's ESL that explains it lay and lie

check that out lay ahead is correct so the the public was very worried because

the future was dark dark days were in front of them Dark Days lie ahead so

they wanted to create these posters to relax the public to comfort the public

to reassure the public don't worry public we are going to take care of you

and we will be strong with your help that's why they made the posters of

course they were required to be uniform in style and were to feature a special

and handsome type face making them difficult for the enemy to

counterfeit okay so they commissioned these posters

there were several different posters with different words but they had to be

uniform in style and that means the style had to be the same the same style

maybe the color was a little bit different actually I have a couple

history books that are uniform in style and you can see if you if you look

here they don't look uniform in style but this is the cover of one the

discoverers and the cover of another The Seekers and the cover of another the

creators ah yes so now if we look at these history books the style they're

uniform in style they are uniform in style so these posters also they had to

be uniform the same type of uniform the same type of style of course there were

some changes here and there so they were they were required to be uniform in

style and were to feature were to feature were to highlight a special

handsome type font or type face and once again if we look at these books the font

this is the the type face this is the font or the type face and I don't know

if it's special but the T and the C are a little bigger the T and the D the T

and the S so this is a special type face or a special type font uh that's

handsome it looks good handsome just means it looks good but here it was also

supposed to be difficult to counterfeit and to counterfeit means to

copy okay when we say counterfeit we should think of counterfeit money

yes um is it easy to copy money well you can make a picture of

money but it's not going to be easy to use that money so that's the idea so

they worry ah now we will make these posters but what if the German Nazis

counterfeit the style and make opposite propaganda posters that

would be a problem do you understand so that's what their concern was they

wanted to be uniform in style with a unique special and handsome typ face and

they must be difficult to

counterfeit they used the crown of King George V 6 as the only graphic device

and had just two colors so on this poster there were no

graphic designs there were there this is a graphic device and this is a graphic

there there was none of this graphic art only the crown of King George V 6 okay

so King George I 6 he was the king and and I guess every King and every Queen

has a unique crown and that was the only graphic device on this poster okay okay

so that was the only graphic device and the posters just had two

colors of the three final designs that went into production the first poster

carried the slogan your courage Your cheerfulness your resolution will bring

us Victory so they chose three designs the

the UK government commissioned posters and many people submitted their ideas

and they said oh we like this one this one and this one so they chose three

designs and they put those designs in production or into production that means

they started printing those posters they started to print the posters now each

poster had a different slogan so it had the King George I 6th crown

and then a slogan something to say the United States propaganda poster I want

you okay so the first poster had this slogan your courage your bravery your

cheerfulness your positive attitude your happiness your resolution resolution

means your mind your mental state so if you make up your mind if you decide to

do something and you're very sure you're very confident you're very strong you

feel strong about your decision you have resolution so if you support the country

there's a war coming there might be you know terrible chaos but you have

resolution yes I know a war is coming and I will fight I will do everything

everything I can to help my country if you have that resolution and the

resolution and the cheerfulness and the courage those three things will bring us

victory that was the first poster what about the second

poster the second poster had the words freedom is in Peril defend it with all

your might freedom is in in Peril freedom is

in danger we might lose Freedom defend it with all your might with all of your

power all of the Power you have you must defend

Freedom that was the second poster and the third

poster but the third design of which over 2 and a half million posters were

printed simply read Keep Calm and Carry

On okay so the third design they printed two and a half million

posters but the slogan was really simple it just said Keep Calm and Carry On

relax and continue doing what you normally do so go to work work go to

school go to the market uh go to the fields take a walk

relax Keep Calm and Carry On and continue to do what you wanted to do

that was the third poster the first two designs were

distributed in September of 1939 and appeared up and down the

country in shop windows and r way platforms so the first two designs

remember the first design said your courage Your cheerfulness your

resolution will bring us victory that was the first design and the second

design freedom is in Peril defend it with all your might those two designs

were printed and distributed in

1939 where were they distributed in shock window

and on train platforms up and down the country so

from the bottom of England to the top of Scotland from the the eastern coast by

London to the western coast out in Wales everywhere so up and down the country

east west north south everywhere up and down the country in shop windows and

train plat forms probably at schools and on street lights everywhere this poster

was distributed and what did they do people

put up the poster they taped it to the wall or to the window so that people

could see it okay but the keep Kong posters were held

in reserve intended for use only in times of crisis

or Invasion okay so the Keep Calm posters

remember keep calm and carry on those posters were not distributed they were

held in reserve what does it mean to hold something in

reserve it means to keep it for later to keep it for an

emergency okay so I always have a little bit of money in

reserve in case there's an emergency I have about

$50 in my bookcase that I keep in reserve also in my car I keep about $20

in reserve I keep it in my car so if I have no gas I can make I can put some

gas in my car so that money is in reserve okay sometimes I store store

energy in reserve actually gas is a very common Reserve countries have food in

reserve do you have any food in reserve in your house do

I yes yes I do I have some frozen food that is not good for me but I keep it in

the freezer in reserve just in case I don't

have other food or just in case I don't want to cook I have that food in

reserve as an emergency last case situation and that

was the case for these posters keep calm and carry on those posters were kept in

reserve for what in the event in case of an invasion

or another crisis so if there was a crisis a really terrible situation then

we will use those posters if there's an invasion if the German Nazis come to

London and attack London then we will use those posters up and down the United

Kingdom do you understand in the end the poster was

never officially issued and it remained unseen by the public until a copy turned

up more than 50 years later in the end end so at the end of

the story World War II was England ever attacked no was

there an invasion no was there a major crisis no so in the end those posters

keep calm and carry on those posters were never issued were never distributed

were never put up so the public never saw those posters they saw the first two

posters but not the third poster and the public didn't see them until about 1990

something in the 1990s and 2000 then the public found them oh here they are and

the sentence was until a copy turned up more than 50 years later so a copy of

the poster turned up somebody found it it's like they're they're going through

old paper oh newspaper wow oh yes oh oh they they turned up and they found the

poster wow what's this keep calling and carry on oh interesting I never saw this

so they discovered it 50 years later it was found in a secondhand

Bookshop called barter books in the northeast corner of

England so where was this poster found where did they turn up this poster

this poster turned up where in a secondhand bookstore in a used

bookstore wow it turned up there and where was this bookstore not in London

but in the northeast corner of England and here's a picture and once again the

name of this bookstore was barter books barter books H that's interesting and

now the video will show you many scenes from the bookstore and the bookstore

looks fantastic I want to go to this bookstore barter books was begun in 1991

by a couple Stuart and Mary Manley barter books began barter books

was begun barter books started barter books first opened in

1991 who opened it a couple a husband and wife and their names were Stuart and

Mary Manley the building used to be an old

Victorian railway station so the barter books bookstore

this building it used to be a long time ago it was something it used to be a

train station a railway station a Victorian railway station

so if we say Victorian we should think of Queen Victoria in the UK and Queen

Victoria was Queen for a long time from like for like 60 years from the

1800s all the way to 1901 1902 something like that you she was Queen for a long

time so that was a train station built during her Reign when she was Queen so a

very old over a hundred years something that was built in the 1800s or the 19th

century an old Victorian train station that's what this building used to

be huge rows of stacked shelves now stand in the place where the tracks

would have been so if this was a train station we

can make a train station basically you've got a platform and then

you've got the tracks right these are the tracks so and this is the building

and people can wait here okay people stand and wait here and maybe other

people can wait over here looks like a subway station anyway so right here

there are tracks these are the tracks okay the railway tracks and the train

comes like this okay and this is this is the train I don't know so but how can

you make this into a bookstore so what they did was they obviously removed the

tracks and right where the tracks are they put bookshelves and now there are

stack bookshelves and people can choose the books so there are stack shelves

where the tracks used to be but the station's old t- rooms and

waiting rooms are still there so the railroad tracks are gone however the

railroad waiting room is still there and the t- room and did you see the t- room

and actually has a fireplace wow this this is a great

bookstore I want to live here it was in 2000 that Stuart found

the poster in a box of Dusty old books that had been bought at

auction okay so they found the poster the poster turned up in the year

2000 and it was in an old dusty box of books okay so I have a box of books hold

on a second I'll bring you a box of books all right here's an old box of

books but it's not Dusty and inside here what do we have ah yeah these are not my

books they're my son's books comic

books yeah blades

something uh Mo uhuh yeah well this this is a an old

box but not bust not Dusty an old box of my son 's books I have to find another

young child to give those books to H yes but there are no posters however the

keep calm and carryon posters were found in an old dusty box of books and where

did they get this Dusty box of books they bought it at an auction and when we

talk about an auction we think hey hey everybody got got a box of books over

here with box and it's only $5 $5 for a box of books $5 going once going hey we

got $6 over here $6 for a box of book $6 for a Boxx of books anybody want a box

of books that's the idea of an auction and

he bought this box of books and he's going through the books and oh the

poster turned up Mary liked it so much she had it

framed and put it up near the shock till so he showed his wife the poster and his

wife Mary she loved the poster oh my goodness this is so interesting it's so

wonderful so she had it framed that means she took the poster and she put a

frame a wooden frame around it and she put it up she put it up near the shop

till and a shop till is a cash register so anytime time somebody went to pay for

a book they would see the poster in the frame and people would say wow

interesting and it proved so popular with the customers that a year later

they began to sell copies so this poster was popular how

popular it proved to be so popular that people want to buy it so they started to

sell copies a year later so what does it mean for something

to prove to be the idea is we start with something

but will it be good or will it be bad H how what will the results be let's

watch so we can watch DDM okay so why did you sign up for d d

m maybe because daily dictation proved to be useful daily dictation proved to

help you improve your listening and pronunciation skills so DDD Pro DD

proved to be useful so you signed up for DDM is that correct I hope so so it's a

very useful expression they say that smoking proves to be dangerous to your

health yes we know smoking if you smoke I no problem no problem but in the end

when you die then you realize maybe the smoking is the number one reason why I

died so smoking proves to be deadly not for everybody but almost

everybody so proves to be good or bad usually that's how we use it okay in

this case proved to be so popular since that time the poster has

been reproduced paraded and trivialized and has become a truly iconic image of

the 21st century since that time since 2000 since

2001 when they began selling the poster since that time the poster keep calm and

and carry on has been reproduced they made it again they reproduced it to make

again they copied it they printed it again parody what does it mean to parody

to parody something means to make fun of something so here are a couple of

examples of the parodies keep c yeah this is some funny stuff and some of

them are really bad so be careful if you do an internet search uh and also

trivialized what does it mean to trivialize something to trivialize

something means to make it unimportant to make it gossip so don't

trivialize my sickness so for example I said oh I'm not feeling well and you

said oh come on you always say you're not feeling well you what's wrong this

time hey don't trivialize my sickness I seriously do not feel well don't make

fun of don't think little of my sickness that's what it means to

trivialize something okay so this poster has been trivialized too all right

however uh it has become a truly iconic image of the 21st century so it was

rediscovered in the year 2000 which means the 21st century but iconic image

is a great expression and when we say iconic image you should be able to think

of many different for example photographs this is an example of an

iconic photograph at the end I'll give you a list of iconic photographs and

I'll give you the background to them this is from the American perspective so

maybe somebody in Russia or Brazil or Vietnam might have different images in

their mind iconic images iconic movies iconic songs these are songs that

everybody knows about that everybody can identify so when I say everybody it

might be everybody around the world but maybe it just means everybody in

your country or everybody in your town okay so I'll talk about iconic images at

the end of the video again it is hard to say exactly why such

a phrase from a bygone decade would have so much appeal and residence now it is

hard to say it is difficult to save it is difficult to understand why that

phrase what phrase keep calm and carry on so it's difficult to understand why

that phrase has so much appeal and resonance now so people nowadays they

really like that expression it has resonance it has resonance with people

to have resonance means it speaks to them

it means something keep calm and carry on oh yes yes that's a really good

expression but we don't know why people like it nowadays because that expression

is from a bygone decade a decade means 10 years bygone

means past so a bygone decade would be a period in the the

past that's gone that we forgot about so this poster this phrase was from a long

time ago and people forgot about it but nowadays people like the expression it

appeals to them and it has resonance it has meaning to people nowadays why it's

hard to say we don't know why its designs considered simple and

Timeless and now commonly recognizable its design is considered

simple yes it's simple and Timeless M Timeless is a nice word Timeless is

something that never gets old so for example Snickers candy bar the Snickers

candy bar when I was young it was popular and now it is popular Snickers

candy bars are Timeless the Rolex watch the Rolex watch

is timeless if it's 5 years old or 50 years

old everybody loves the Rolex watch it's Timeless and this poster it's design is

timeless it's a perfect I mean it was a good design 60 years ago and it's a good

design now so this Poster's design is timeless and now commonly recognizable

when people see the design oh they recognize oh yes Keep Calm and Carry

On however it is perhaps the words on the poster that people find most

enchanting however it is probably not the

design it's probably the words on the poster the slogan the message those are

what people find most enchanting most interesting most endearing people like

the words the meaning not the design not the color not the type face but the

words like a voice out of History it offers a very simple warm-hearted

message to inspire confidence and others during difficult

times so this poster doesn't have a voice but when we see it we can almost

hear the 1940s style news voice hello everybody

and in 1940 in London there is a war happening so we can hear that voice and

we can hear the voice saying keep calm and carry on it's like a voice from the

past a voice from history talking to us and it tells us a very

simple a very warmhearted message it's a simple message it comes from the heart

keep calm and carry on and this message inspires confidence

it it gives people confidence it makes people feel confident yes yes carry on I

must carry on for my country it gives people

confidence to anybody to people especially during difficult

times during war or whatever the situation so this

expression during World War II was a great expression keep calm and carry on

it gives people confidence but even now in

2013 there are many difficult times that people have economic difficulties and

War and so many difficulties and so so many

countries and when we see this expression keep calm and carry

on that's good advice and it gives people

confidence and those words are probably why people like this

poster and it's something that should never fade from Fashion to keep calm and

carry on yes it's something this poster though

words those words that phrase is something that should never fade from

Fashion to fade from Fashion to be in fashion means to be popular to fade from

Fashion means to not be popular okay so when I go to sleep every night when I go

to sleep I wear a hat and I'll show you my sleeping

hat this is my sleeping hat uh and I wear this when I go to bed now

a long time ago people used to wear hats like this it was called a sleeping hat

or a sleeping cap is it still in fashion

no this type of sleeping hat has faded from Fashion but that phrase keep calm

and carryon should never fade from fashion and I agree it's a great

expression especially if somebody is experiencing

difficulty Keep Calm and Carry On are great words to build

confidence some if somebody tells you keep calm and carry on you might get

angry but if you see it on the wall it might actually help you it's

good propaganda I don't don't like propaganda

but that that's that's good

propaganda okay to finish out today's lesson I want to talk about some iconic

images so some of these images are not good pictures there's nothing too

terrible but this is from an American's perspective Americans will all recognize

these photographs these iconic images some of them are great great some of

them are beautiful some of them are tragic and I'm curious do you also

recognize these iconic images the first iconic photo I want to

show you is a picture of our world this is a beautiful picture it's

taken from the Moon and we call it the Big Blue Marble that is the Earth's

nickname and it looks so beautiful it looks so

peaceful this is a picture of a man on the moon I think it's ball Buzz Aldren I

think is the astronaut but let's go back to Earth and uh well here's a picture of

a polar bear this became a symbol of global

warming then we have a picture of a starving child in Africa and in the

background is is a vulture the bird it's a very famous

photograph let's go back in time a little bit this is I believe uh it's a

construction picture I believe making the Empire State Building these men are

floating over New York City eating lunch this is a picture of Gandhi an

iconic picture an iconic man this is a famous picture in America

it's from the depression the Great Depression

1932 in America when people had a very difficult economic

time this is in World War II iojima this is when US

soldiers overtook Japanese soldiers on the island of iojima and they're raising

that's those are Marines and they're raising the American

flag more War photos this is 1963 in Vietnam a Buddhist monk is

protesting the South actually not the North and uh he is he has burned himself

he didn't move at all that was 1963 here's another Vietnamese uh

Vietnam War picture um this is a tragic picture it's called the Napalm girl the

US soldiers US military used Napalm and burned the jungle and many children and

mothers and grandmothers lost their lives because of that here we have a

South Vietnamese police chief I think he's a

police chief I think it's from Saigon and he's

executing uh Viet Kong prisoner Viet Kong would be the North or the

Communist let's leave war and go back to Kittyhawk this is the right Brothers one

of their first flights not the first flight I don't think but one of their

first flights airplanes when they first began this is an iconic picture of

Marilyn Monroe I think everybody is familiar with this picture this is a

picture of President Johnson being sworn in as the US president after the

assassination of John F Kennedy next to him you can see Jacqueline

Kennedy this is a picture from National Geographic it's called the Afghanistan

girl and uh this was a long time ago 1986 87 88 a long time ago and

Afghanistan of course nowadays is also in the news then we have from I think

1960 this is CH gavara very famous leader Guerilla

leader in uh South America and finally the tenan square the man standing in

front of those tanks truly an iconic picture from the uh from the 19 uh was

that 1989 gosh I can't remember I think it

was 1989 maybe 1990 so these are econ iconic

images can you add one do you have a favorite are you familiar with all of

them is there a new one let me

know
