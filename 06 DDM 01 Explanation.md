well I hope you enjoyed the first scene of this situation comedy it's pretty

funny but do you understand everything okay in the beginning there

are two guys talking one guy is Jerry and the short bald guy he's George okay

they're at Jerry's house and George is complaining George is always complaining

do you have your text let's see what they say George says I can't believe

this ah something something must be really bad this is crazy what is this oh

my goodness I can't believe this Jerry says oh it won't be for that long it

will just be for a short time what is this what is it I can't believe this

what is this it won't be for that long it what is it we don't know but it's not

good but it will be just for a short period Jerry says George how could I do

this oh how could I do this why am I doing this oh this is so

stupid how could I move back in with those people now we understand so George

lives by himself in an apartment but now he has to move back in

so the key word here is to move back in okay so the verb is to move in so if you

move that means you go from one house to another house okay so I moved in to

this house two years ago maybe in April I will move in to another house I don't

know back now what does back mean back means again so it has the Nuance of

again so one day maybe I will move back to

America my home state is Wisconsin will I move back to Wisconsin probably not

but I might move back to America what about if I moved to my

parents house in that situation move back into

my parents house that would be terrible because because in

America once you're 18 19 20 years old we move out we move out of our house

to an apartment we live alone we like to become independent not every American

but most Americans like to live alone live by themselves no parents no

rules eating food in front of the TV at 2 a.m. sleeping all day on the weekend

no rules no parents yes do you live alone have you ever

lived alone after living alone would you like

to move back into your parents house that would

be terrible that would be terrible but why would you have to maybe you have no

money maybe you're sick maybe you cannot cook food maybe you cannot do laundry

there are many reasons to move back in to your parents'

house but you lose your Independence so George said how could I

move back in with those people who are those people I I don't

know please tell me please Jerry he's talking to Jerry tell me they're insane

they're crazy they're nuts they're Bonkers those people are crazy you know
-----------------------------
that and Jerry says let me go down hey my parents are just as crazy as

your parents now we know George has to move back into his parents house he's

like 35 years old and he has to go back into his parents' house so George is

frustrated oh no my parents are crazy but Jerry says hey my parents are just

as crazy as your parents your parents and my parents are equally crazy both

are crazy are your parents

crazy sometimes they do crazy things are my parents

crazy no Mom and Dad you're not crazy I love

you they might be watching the video so I can't really say uh but most parents

have some crazy things that they do not all parents so the next sentence so

George replies and he's a little bit angry how can you compare your parents

to my parents how can you do that you cannot compare your parents to my

parents your parents are apples my parents are oranges they're totally

different you cannot compare them and now there's a competition Jerry

huh my father has never thrown anything out

ever my father is so crazy he has never in his life thrown anything out to throw

out something to throw away something like trash or Garbage we throw it out we

throw it out so for example I have a well I have a very dirty eraser this

is a chalkboard eraser and I need to to throw it out because it's too dirty but

I don't know why I will throw it out now yes I will throw it out

now there now I have thrown out the Eraser I will never see it again but

Jerry's father never throws out anything ever and he uses the word ever to

emphasize so for example one of my students asked me Shane do you eat dog

meat oh I will never eat dog meat ever grammatically is that

correct no but that's what we say I will never do something ever I will never get

married ever I will never uh go to war ever I will never

drive too fast ever so we we can use it as a uh to emphasize that you will never

do something yeah that's daily English disregards the grammar so my father has

never thrown out anything ever my father has never thrown anything out ever okay

use the body language George says oh yeah my father wears his sneakers in the

pool sneak sneakers what are

sneakers these are sneakers sneakers are basically shoes that you

wear when you exercise they're very casual

shoes they usually have a rubber bottom or Sole and they're made of canvas or of

Leather So basketball shoes we can call those sneakers running shoes shoes can

also be called sneakers tennis shoes could be called sneakers I believe in

the UK they also say trainers some people love to collect

sneakers especially basketball shoes in my case I do not collect Sneakers but

George's Dad wears his sneakers in the pool in the swimming pool when George's

dad goes swimming in a swimming pool he's wearing his

sneakers that's crazy George's dad and Jerry's dad are both a little crazy so

now it's time to talk about the mothers Jerry says my mother has never

set foot in a natural body of water my mother has never set foot in a natural

natural body of water so great expression has never done something what

set foot in to set foot in means to step into some place to step into some place

so for me I have never set foot in a woman's bathroom never never in my life

but the important thing is the Nuance is I have never done it and I never will I

don't want to I don't want to go to a woman's bathroom I'll just go to the

men's bathroom or my bathroom at home I have never set foot in something

something so uh it doesn't necessarily mean you don't want to but usually it

does I'll give you an opposite situation my friend asks me hey Shane would you

like to visit a Muslim Mosque oh wow I've never set foot in a Muslim Mosque

yes that would be great so in this situation oh he's inviting me to a

mosque I have never been to a mosque yes I would like to go I have never set foot

in a Muslim Mosque so be careful as to how you say it generally I would say 60

70% of the time you've never done it you've never been there and you don't

want to so be careful as to how you say it or pay attention to the person that's

speaking oh a Mosk wow I've never set foot in a mosque sure that means I want

to okay so never set foot in what in this case a natural body of water so

look at the word natural body of water yes natural the opposite of natural

is manmade so natural

man-made so man-made when we talk about a man-made body of water we can think of

a lake that was made by a dam or a reservoir for the city's water these are

manmade by bodies of water a natural body of water would be the ocean or the

sea or a pond or a lake or a river or a stream these are natural bodies of water

why do we say a body of water well the Nuance is we look at the whole thing the

entire thing the Amazon River is a body of water

usually we think of a lake or a sea or an ocean so I'm from Wisconsin we have

many lakes I would love to live by that body

of water I would love to live by that Lake that's the idea okay so George's

mom has never set foot in a body of in a in a natural body of water that means

Jerry's mom that means she has never been

in the ocean she has never been in a lake she has never been in a river why

not well actually I do know people who are afraid of fish and other things in

the water they think there's a monster in the water so a swimming pool is okay

you can see everything but the ocean a lake you cannot see anything oh it's too

scary maybe Jerry's mom is is afraid of natural bodies of water but then George

George has to compete George says listen carefully and remember the body language

listen carefully listen

carefully my mother has never laughed ever

not a giggle not a chuckle not a te he never went

ha wow George's mother must be kind of scary she's never laughed in her life

never laughing

is laughing that's natural laughing not a giggle g i g g l e what is a

giggle so for example if you have a brother or

a sister or a husband or a wife and you tickle

them that's a giggle comes from the

stomach comes from the throat giggle do you know Elmo from Sesame Street he has

a giggle sorry uh not a chuckle a chuckle

with be a very short

laugh that would be a chuckle sometimes a chuckle you chuckle when you don't

want to laugh you're trying not to laugh that would be a

chuckle what about a t te te on YouTube there is a famous YouTube

guy his name is Higa he's an Asian funny YouTuber and at the end of his

videos he always says te and it just means but does anybody

laugh like that oh maybe some people

do oh so if you laugh like like a horse then you

T never went ha never went now grammatically she never never went she

never went what do you mean went she never ha ha we say went she never went

she never said is the Nuance she never said

ha so in America the laughing sound is ha

haaaa my mother never even said ha nothing no laughing zero no Giggles no

teeh no Chuckles no ha no nothing Jerry

says smirk

smirk what does smirk mean smirk is is basically

this did you see it look at my

expression this is kind of a laugh but it's a very negative laugh it's an evil

laugh it it means that I feel better than you h

you're studying English you study with

shame that would be a smirk smirks are evil so has your mom maybe she's smirked

before and George says maybe maybe she has smirked and then and I'm moving back

there and I'm moving back there what am I doing my mom and dad are crazy I will

lose my freedom I'm moving back there this is terrible the next

sentence Jerry says I told you I would lend you I'd lend you I would lend you I

told you that I would lend you the money the money why the money because we know

the money for the rent ah so George pays rent every month so he needs

$600 every month I'll give you the money I'll give you the

$600 I told you I would give you the money for the rent don't worry and

George says no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no borrowing money from a

friend is like having sex borrowing money from a friend is the

same as having sex with a friend okay so let's talk about sex if

you have a friend just a friend do you have sex no you you you

shouldn't and George is saying so you don't do that so if you have a friend do

you borrow money no you shouldn't so George says you shouldn't have sex with

a friend and you shouldn't borrow money from a friend is that true his next

sentence it just completely changes everything it completely changes the

relationship if you borrow money with somebody the relationship changes if you

have sex with a friend the relationship changes is that

true yes I think it's true so remember never borrow money from your friends the

relationship might change I know $1 $5 $10 that's okay but

$600 ,000 actually in New York City the rent

can be really expensive I had a friend 20 years ago

yeah about 20 years ago and he had an apartment in New York City nothing

special at all I think he paid like

$600 20 years ago every month this was his monthly rent

monthly yeah monthly rent every month he paid

$1,600 and he had to pay for his car car parking was about the same about

$1,200 for parking so every month he paid

$2,800 just to rent his apartment and to rent a parking space that's a lot of

money so if my friend lost his job he might say to me Shane can you borrow

$2,800 to me can you lend $2,800 to me oh I'm sorry I'm not going to

because borrowing money between friends changes the relationship is that true I

think it might be true I think so I think so okay at this point Kramer comes

in now Kramer is Jerry's neighbor Kramer has really crazy

hair George and Jerry are friends from middle school Kramer is just the

neighbor Kramer is pretty funny Kramer has no job but somehow he has money not

a lot of money but but some money and he always goes to Jerry's house and takes

Jerry's food and stuff like that uh in this case we call him a leech l c Kramer

is a leech and a leech is somebody who always takes things from their friends

with no problem oh oh oh is that candy oh thank you they go to your house oh

can I open oh oh yes refrigerator take some milk thank you that's a leech

Kramer is a leech but Kramer is a good guy okay so Kramer comes in and he says

all right I'm ready and then to George you know I still don't understand why do

you want to move back in with your parents that's right and once again in

America if you live alone for a couple years you never want to move back in

with your parents you want to be independent especially when you're young

so Kramer I don't understand why do you want to move back in with your parents

why and George says I don't want to I don't want to I'm out of money I don't

have any more money my money is gone I have no choice no job no money no house

I must move back in to my parents house I got 7

$14 in the bank $714 that's nothing that's terrible my

rent is about

$714 Kramer says well move in here move into Jerry's house don't go back to your

parents move here move to Jerry's house and Jerry says what's that what

huh what did you just just say and we can sense Jerry does not like the idea

no no no no no no no no George cannot move here nobody moves to my

house so Jerry says what's that what's that and Kramer why doesn't he just move

in here why doesn't he just move in here come on why not what's the problem you

guys are friends best friends he can live here and George he

says I'm gonna move in with him I'm gonna move in with Jerry it's sarcasm

sarcastic the meaning is the opposite I'm GNA move in with Jerry are

you crazy no way never no thank you why he doesn't even let you use the toilet

Jerry doesn't even allow you to use the toilet if you want to use the bathroom

at Jerry's house you have to ask Jerry may I use the bathroom uh no I didn't

clean it okay I'll go to the train station bye Jerry doesn't even let you

use the bathroom unless you ask permission no I do not want to live with

Jerry if I lived with Jerry it would be too frustrating okay uh then Kramer

Kramer says you can move in with me see Kramer is a very nice guy but look at

Kramer does he look like a really clean guy not

really now you you guys may not know Kramer Kramer's great but I wouldn't

want to be Kramer's roommate either he's just weird

something strange about Kramer and I would not want to do that

uh and George has the same feeling as me so he said you can move in with me if

you want George says thank you oh that's very nice of you oh thank you very much

but I uh that might not work out me moving in with you you might not

work out might not be a good idea if I moved into your apartment that might not

have a happy ending eventually we might kill each

other and that is the first scene okay so it's not too difficult I hope

probably you understood most of it and uh I hope that you like Seinfeld and if

you have any questions please ask I want you to practice the roles practice the

speaking the pronunciation the body language make it natural and I want to

see you at the Google Hangouts so that I can watch you practice and I can hear

your pronunciation remember our mission is to master English but it's going to

take a lot of practice okay so I'm going to be tough so you guys need to practice

hard that's it and uh get the MP3 files listen and practice and join me in the

Google Hangout

bye-bye
