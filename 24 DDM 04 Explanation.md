okay now it's time to talk about these two advertisements that we studied for

ddm4 they were both of the same company the company name is

allate and it's a very famous very big insurance company in America when we

talk about insurance remember there are many types of insurance there's car

insurance health insurance insurance for your home insurance for your bicycle you

could buy that there's renters insurance if you rent an apartment you can get

that type of insurance and even some Hollywood stars they ensure their body

their nose or their butt or their legs you can ensure anything you want and

what's the purpose of insurance well if you if something

happens to your house or your car then you will receive money to fix the house

or the car or to replace the house or the car do you understand what happens

if you lose your leg do they give you money to replace your leg maybe I'm not

too sure about that but anyway these commercials are pretty funny commercials

and the first commercial was about two guys and they're they they're across the

street or actually they're next door they're barbecuing and they look next

door and they see the neighbor and in the neighbor's lawn there are many big

toys for big boys and that's what we say big toys for big boys there were there

was a boat a big truck a motorcycle many different things actually at the end of

the video I'll talk about the big toys for big boys okay so anyway all of these

nice toys this boat and the Motorcycle all of those things require

insurance and for example a motorcycle insurance for a motorcycle is not that

cheap so if it's expensive if it's kind of dangerous like a motorcycle the

insurance Price goes up just like on a car if you had a car like this the

insurance rate is not bad but if you had a car like this wow extremely expensive

Insurance very expensive so depending on the item it can be really expensive

insurance or cheap insurance so let's look at the first

couple of

lines whoa look at all those toys eh ensuring that stuff must be a

pain whoa oh my God wow stop look look at all those toys wow that guy has so

many great boy toys toys for boys big toys for big boys wow eh insuring that

stuff must be a pain insuring getting insurance for all of those toys must be

a pain in the butt a pain in the neck a pain in the ass

it must be very tedious it must take a lot of work a lot of paperwork a lot of

money ah it sounds like a hassle it sounds like too much work no thank you I

don't want those toys it's too much work nah he's probably got all stinct

they can bundle all your policies together nah no I'm sure that guy the

neighbor uses All State Insurance he has All State Insurance and All State

Insurance is very convenient because they will take all the different items

the motorcycle the truck the boat the house all of those items and they put it

into one they bundle it together so it's very convenient it's not tedious it's

not a pain you don't need to have separate

insurance policies for everything you can just have one insurance policy with

all of those items in it it's convenient All State Insurance is

easy a lot of paperwork a lot of paperwork so the guy says nah I'm still

not interested too much paperwork actually an Allstate agent can

help do the switching and paperwork for you no you're wrong the Allstate

Insurance agent the person who sells the insurance the person who gives you the

insurance contract that person can help you switch companies switch insurance

companies move insurance companies and that person can do the paperwork for you

it's easy all you do is sign your name you're

done well it probably costs a lot All State can save you up to 30%

more when you bundle well it probably costs a lot I

think I wrote cost in your original script it should be costs it probably

costs a lot I'm sure it's expensive but no no you can save up to 30% more when

you bundle if you have many things to get insurance for if you bundle it

together if you make it into one you can save a lot of money 30% 30%

savings well is dog stupid poodles are one of the world's

smartest breeds and then we see this dog who who

drops a ball into the next yard so the guy the guy who doesn't like like the

neighbor well his dog's stupid his dog's an idiot it's it's a stupid dog but then

the other guy well actually poodles are one of the most intelligent one of the

smartest breeds there are many breeds of dogs my favorite dog is the kie ah when

I was young I had a kie it was great its name was

copper and uh another dog I love is the Labrador oh yes the labrador retriever

or we can say the golden retriever or the black lab beautiful dog very gentle

very nice in Korea a dog native to Korea is the

Jindo they also have the Saar and the I think it's called the pan

yeah they have three dogs native to Korea what about in your country do you

have a dog that's native to your country let me know I know in Russia they have

the Siberian Husky uh I know they have some dog in

China I can't remember the name it's got the wrinkles yeah uh I guess maybe the

poodle is from France well they say the poodle is one

of the most intelligent breeds one of the most intell ENT types of dogs is

that true my uh my friend used to have a poodle and the only thing the poodle

would do was

bark it was terrible it was mean I didn't like it it was a little tiny

curly fur I didn't like it I like big dogs

that's right big dogs are my favorite breeds and they can be stupid I don't

mind stupid dog dogs as long as they don't drink water out of the toilet and

as long as they don't eat my shoes as long as they don't poop on my

floor then I like big dogs but big dogs need places to run so the city is not a

place for a big dog if I move to the country I'll get a big dog and I'll take

a picture and I'll introduce him to you so anyway the poodle is supposed to be

one of the smartest dogs in the world maybe bundle and save with an Allstate

agent are you in good hands so here is the point of the advertisement bundle if

you have many different things that require Insurance bundle bundle it

together group them together bundle and save with all state at all state sh you

can bundle together and you can save up to

30% and then all states slogan their motto is you're in good hands with all

state are you in good hands it's a great slogan actually for

our classes I have a slogan I need to use it more My slogan is if you can say

it you can hear it if you can say it the same as a native English speaker you can

hear it if if you can say it you can hear it now are you in good hands you're

in good hands with all state what does that mean if you're in good hands it

means somebody is taking good care of you hopefully you feel that way about me

hopefully you think yes Shane is helping me with my English maybe my

pronunciation maybe my listening skills maybe my cultural knowledge Shane is

helping me with my English skills so you could say I'm in good hands with Coach

Shane yeah I hope so let's go to the next advertisement and this was funny

this is a character the man and his name is Mayhem and he does many commercials

and in every commercial he comes out as a different character some sometimes as

a girl sometimes as an object sometimes as snow sometimes as an animal this time

he came out as a dog I'm your dog holding down the fort while you're out

catching a movie lucky for me your friend showed up with this awesome

bone so you have to imagine that that guy Mayhem is actually your dog and the

dog is guarding your house but guarding the house is one expression holding down

the fort is another expression do you know what a fort is a fort is basically

a military base and well here's a picture in America when we say Fort we

think of the traditional western style fort in the cowboy country in Texas and

places like that an army for Fort so holding down the fort means protecting

the fort okay holding down everything keeping everything calm and safe and

protected so if I go on a vacation for two weeks or one month I like somebody

to hold down the fort what that means is one of my

friends will come to my house and check the mail and maybe turn the lights on

and turn the lights off okay that way a burglar a thief doesn't

visit my house he's holding down my house sometimes at the company your boss

goes on a business
