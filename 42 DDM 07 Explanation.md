all right now it's time to talk about ddm7 and explain it well in the first

line I have Jerry's apartment George is showing off his hands I'm sorry I made a

spelling mistake showing off to show off something what does it

mean to show off something to brag about something hey look at my my hands oh my

goodness they're manly they're powerful and yet they're very clean the nails are

perfect length oh these hands are beautiful showing off his hands so when

we uh have our hangout I want you guys to show off something maybe you can show

off a watch or your cell phone I want you to show off something I'll show off

my watch this is this is uh one of my watches it's fantastic let me uh show

you how it looks yeah oh yeah very nice it's got a good leather strap it's thick

and powerful and yet the battery is not working but I will wear it anyway oh it

feels so good and it looks good it makes my arm look more powerful and

massive showing off practice I want you guys to show off in the Hangouts Okay

okay good so George is showing off his hands and Jerry asked the question what

is it JY says I don't know they're

hands do you understand what is it my question is it what is it what is it

what is it do you know what it is well it in this situation is what is

so special about your hands what is so special about your hands I don't know

they're hands and their hands means they're just hands there's nothing

special look at my head isn't it amazing what is it it's my

head it's just your head but it's my head okay so what is it what makes it so

special it's a very good expression so for

example you could go to a restaurant and you're having spaghetti oh there's

spaghetti is so good what is it about their spaghetti why is their spaghetti

so good or I have have some coffee hold on yes this

stuff what is it about Starbucks Coffee something something's weird about

Starbucks Coffee it tastes so good what is it h it's a great expression and once

again in this case what is it what is so special about your hands okay uh George

says I don't know but this woman this woman that he met at the restaurant has

already set me up for a job she has lined me up for a job she has a job and

she's set me there she's put me in line for the job I am getting a job because

of my hands it's

amazing Jerry doesn't know Jerry's Jerry's your hands and my hands they're

the same they're just hands Jerry doesn't get doesn't understand the

difference but George says no no no no no are you kidding what are you kidding

your hands have have many flaws flaws f l a WS flaws are problems things that

are wrong with something so for example my my

face my face is perfect no I have many flaws with my

face I have bad teeth uh my my mustache isn't fully enough um what else I've got

too many wrinkles yeah I've got too many wrinkles I'm losing my hair on the top

my I got a rising for I have many flaws many problems we all have flaws about

something but George is is going to describe Jerry's flaws with his hands

and he says the knuckles are all out of proportion so these are Knuckles we got

one two three okay three knuckles in your hands and the fingers let's talk

about the fingers the pinky the small finger the ring finger the fourth finger

the middle finger the uh third finger the index finger or the pointer or the

first finger and the thumb the thumb we don't call the thumb a finger actually

it is but these are the fingers your four fingers and your thumb but most

people will say five fingers okay so this is your palm your palm and this

this is the back of your hand and these two three are the knuckles one two 3 one

two three and only two for the thumb those are the knuckles so some people uh

they like to pop their Knuckles or crack their

Knuckles did you hear it yeah I could pop I po this knuckle

yeah ow uh anyway if you pop your knuckles a lot

I heard that they get bigger they swell up and if you get older like maybe you

know 60 70 80 years old sometimes you have arthritis which is when your joints

are very painful and your knuckles will swell up so your knuckles are bigger

than your fingers that is out of proportion your knuckles are out of

proportion he tells Jerry your knuckles are out of proportion it doesn't look

good yeah that's possible if you got out of proportion Knuckles it's not going to

look good that's one of my problems my body is huge but my head is really small

I've got like a pin head so my head is out of proportion with my

body yeah uh maybe sometimes we can there's this situation do you guys know

Mike Tyson Mike Tyson is a the Box boxer did you ever hear Mike Tyson speak he's

a huge guy but his voice is like this yeah man I'm GNA kill you I'm going to M

his voice doesn't match his body it's out of proportion we could say that his

voice is disproportionate to his body yeah man

come here I'm going to kill you it sounds cute Mike Tyson is cute not uh

okay so anyway your knuckles are out of proportion you got hair over there so

he's got hairy Knuckles he's got hairy Knuckles he's like a monkey people my

dad has hairy knuckles I have hair on my Knuckles but you can't really see it uh

then George says where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands where

do you get off now if we take a bus where do you

you get off where do you get off the bus but in this situation where do you get

off means where on how on Earth could you do

something another expression are you blind where do you get off saying I'm

handsome are you blind do you have eyes are you sick are you crazy where do you

get off saying I'm handsome what about uh uh Shane your Russian is really good

SP my Russian Shane's R is Shane's Russian where do you get off saying that

Shane can speak Russian he knows one word two words

vodka dvad another word my Korean is okay so Shane you speak Korean well

thank you Shane you speak French well well mer

mer

s yeah where do you get off saying that Shane can speak good Korean where do you

get off how on Earth could you do something are you blind are you deaf if

we're talking about sound are you deaf but here we're talking about hands and

the visual so are you blind is possible okay okay um so they compare uh George

says this hand is a one in a million hand this hand is very rare you will

only see this hand once out of a million hands 500,000 people one hand amazing

hand so he's a hand model and Jerry says well I guess that's

what comes from avoiding a life of manual labor manual labor your whole

life what is manual labor manual labor is working like a man well yeah but

working with your hands manual means working with your hands so farming and

Factory working uh car mechanics is a doctor they work with their hands are

they doing manual labor no man manual labor makes you sweat manual labor makes

you dirty manual labor needs muscles manual labor is not easy it's tough

stuff do you like manual labor well I can do manual labor but I

don't like manual labor yeah it's not easy that's why we have

machines so my question for you guys what was the last type of manual labor

you did did maybe it was shoveling the snow yes shoveling the snow clearing the

snow that is Manual Labor uh but I'm curious I I can think

of a lot of examples but I'm curious about your manual labor the last time

you did Manual Labor what was it okay and another question what sort of things

in life do you avoid what types of things do you try try to avoid probably

we try to avoid manual labor but do you try to avoid doing your homework doing

the dictation oh I got to do my dictation I don't want to do the

dictation I'm going to avoid it maybe there's somebody you are trying to

avoid your friend or your girlfriend uh your wife is that my wife

I think my wife's home I better be re

quiet that's the idea so what kind of things are you trying to avoid in the

Hangouts I want you to talk about

that once again George is excited this is it it's happened to

me what is it what has happened to George this is

it it's happened to me do you know what it

is explain it tell me what it is in the hangout that's my question okay what is

it and don't disregard the

pronouns be sure you can explain what the pronoun is what's the noun this is

it it's happened to me it's finally happened to me uh I was sitting in a

restaurant the the two nut jobs his parents never call your parents nut jobs

unless you really really really love them then you can call them nut jobs uh

the two nut jobs were talking I couldn't take it anymore ah it was too

frustrating Mom and Dad are talking silver dollars and be a postman ah I

couldn't take it anymore I had to get up and leave I

couldn't take it anymore I couldn't endure it anymore it was too much oh it

was suffocating it was frustrating when was the last time you

couldn't take it anymore what was the it in this case I couldn't take it anymore

I couldn't take my parents talking and talking and nagging and stories I

couldn't take it anymore I couldn't take they talking anymore what about you the

last time you couldn't take it anymore what was the it and what did you do for

me yeah actually many situations when I can't take it anymore I have a cigarette

it's a stress reliever I need to change my routine and if I can't take it

anymore I'm going to go exercise that would be a great

alternative what do you do when you can't take it

anymore well George gets up from the table and he wants to go have some fresh

air he wants to to breathe and I bop into boom Bop into run into this

woman and Jerry says it's just like in the movies wow you meet this woman and

she changes your life that is a Hol ollywood

movie it's the same as a Hollywood movie it's just like in the

movies have you ever had an experience that was just like in the movies can you

share that experience I have one I'll tell you

quickly when I was in the Army I was repelling down a mountain I was using a

rope and I was climbing down a cliff okay and as I was climbing down the Rope

broke yes and I fell about 10 m a pretty long distance and I fell and I landed on

a little cliff and I was okay I boom I hit and I

had my helmet on so I didn't hurt myself but I was like oh and I'm on my

back and I couldn't breathe I'm okay I'm okay but then the cliff is not like this

the cliff was like this so my body started to slide down the cliff and if

it goes here it's about 40 m about 40 m so it was really dangerous and I it was

just like in a Hollywood movie that was an experience just like in a Hollywood

movie what about you can you tell us about

some experience you had that was just like in the

movies at this point Kramer walks in and Kramer is very popular Kramer says hi to

George and it's strange but Kramer shakes his hand that's possible yeah

usually between friends we don't shake hands but it's possible but Kramer is a

a jokester he's making a practical joke and in his hand he has a buzzer an

electronic button so if you shake somebody's

hands you get an electric shock and it's very

surprising have you ever tried one of these they're they're pretty

shocking it's very surprising once again it's an electric buzzer and he shakes

George hand and George goes crazy so um that we call it a joy buzzer or a hand

buzzer George says what are you crazy you could have hurt my hand you

could have damaged my hand okay remember this is George's money he must protect

his hand so it's perfect timing the irony Kramer used uses a buzzer a joy

buzzer on George's moneymaking hand it's the irony is too funny but I want to

talk about practical jokes practical jokes so at the end of this video I'll

have a series of pictures and I'll be describing practical jokes practical

jokes can be really fun and really funny but sometimes they can be dangerous too

so please at the end of the video watch the lesson about practical

jokes so Kramer was unaware that George had become a hand model and now Kramer

wants to inspect George's hands let me see let me see and George says you can

look at them but do not touch them and this is kind of funny um when we were

children we used to use expressions like that and parents sometimes use

expressions like that I remember back in 1994 95 one of my friends had a cell

phone that looked like this okay this was a huge cell phone but nobody had

cell phones at that time it was very rare so he was very rich and people

would see his phone oo he must be rich and I remember asking him hey can I use

your phone and he says no you may look at it but you cannot touch it and that

was the case a long time ago when people bought something very expensive you can

look but don't touch don't touch not touchy you can look but you cannot touch

yeah children do that parents do that at the store

Jimmy you can look at the glass deer but don't touch it and sometimes at jewelry

stores they will have you can look but do not touch antique stores look but no

touch they'll have that written so it's it's possible have you ever used that

expression well anyway Kramer is inspecting George's hands and just wow

my goodness I've never noticed this is amazing

H they're smooth my hands are not too smooth what's the opposite of smooth

give me the appropriate word the opposite of

smooth they're they're creamy now creamy actually means not like butter or peanut

butter or cheese it actually means white the color creamy white now my hands are

creamy the the color we could call that is creamy cuz it's not white I mean

white is like the Whiteboard okay so creamy would be a better description

okay uh so creamy that's typical for white hands uh delicate delicate I don't

think my hands are delicate what's the opposite of delicate

think of a word regarding hands that's the opposite of delicate so once again

and masculine masculine the opposite is feminine feminine masculine means

manlike feminine means ladylike is this what a lady

does I don't think so sorry ladies anyway uh so I have two questions smooth

and delicate what are the opposite words when describing hands okay not for other

situations for hands very good words so think about that how to describe hands

okay and can you find three adjectives to

describe your your hands uh or describe something else uh about yourself three

adjectives three adjectives to describe your hands or maybe your your face or

your hair o that would be a good one yeah let's do that three adjectives to

describe your hair be creative be creative use the dictionary it's okay

it's not cheating okay so that's what I want you to do I want three adjectives

to describe your hair the opposite of smooth and the opposite of I have to

look it up delicate okay that's your assignment and I'll want I want those

answers in the

hangout and the final scene is crazy to protect his hands George is wearing oven

mitts oh my God so he's walking around New York City wearing oven mitts to

protect his hands ah yeah George is amazing well I

guess if you have something valuable you need to protect it I have my cell phone

my cell phone somewhere and I have a cell phone case it protects my cell

phone case uh I don't think I have any other protection but that's the idea so

it's it's pretty funny so he's wearing oven mitts that's all I could find

George says that's all I could find all now instead of all what can we say

that's all I could find that's all I could find instead of

all that's the only thing I could find so all is interesting all can mean

everything and all can mean the only thing I want all I want

everything uh all I have is $5 the only thing I have is

$5 so be careful with the word all and once again in this case that's all I

could find I couldn't find anything else that's the only thing I could find oven

mitts to protect my hands yeah that's pretty crazy and then George becomes a

primadana a prima or a

diva uh what is a primadana what is a diva it's a person usually a woman but

men can be it too that think they're like a prince or a superstar and they

don't want to do anything so please oh the video is done please stop the video

I don't want to stop the video oh my goodness could you please give me some

tea oh thank you and put some honey in the tea oh yes and a little bit of milk

oh thank you yes and would you stir stir it please I don't want to stir it and is

it hot please touch the glass is it hot is it okay okay then I will try it oh

it's too hot no this is a primadana a diva so these people like

Superstars I heard that I think Britney Spears when she goes on a concert to to

Australia they have to prepare special snacks and special water and special

sandwiches with everything is special because she only likes it that way being

a primadana is not a good thing we we must not be a primadana so when were you

ever a primadana come on you probably are people have to do something for you

be honest and give an example and I think that's pretty much it they open

the door for George and George leaves to go to his modeling job now that's the uh

explanation for ddm7 I think it was kind of easy I hope so I hope you understood

everything right now I'm going to start a section on practical jokes practical

jokes are pretty funny uh but they can be dangerous so enjoy the picture

pictures and my descriptions and that's it we have one more DDM left now

practical [Music]

jokes nowadays one of the most common types of practical jokes is doing

something to somebody's office and here you see tinf foil

everywhere and here you see newspaper everywhere can you imagine going to work

in the morning and discovering your office has been

destroyed but it's not really destroyed it's just covered and here's one with

poits yeah these guys get pretty uh pretty

creative another type of practical joke is taping the sign kick me on the back

of someone so we did this in school but would you do this at the office put this

on your boss kick me and then people have to walk around kicking the

boss what a great idea when I was young we did this we go

to a restaurant and the salt shaker it's a screw on top we would would loosen the

top so the next guy who used the salt shaker got all of the salt it's terrible

I know it's terrible we were evil kids now this is really bad putting a

mouse trap by your bed oh my goodness that would be painful

now that would be a painful very painful practical joke I love this one it looks

like all the school teach are out for a big picture everybody

looks good and then the students are on top of the roof dumping water on all of

their teachers that's a great practical joke That's a classic I'm going to do

that here's another funny one we take Saran wrap this clear wrap and we wrap a

toilet so that the person who goes pee they don't really see it

and the pee doesn't go into the toilet it stays on top of the Saran

Wrap it's really funny this is a nice little joke you can

do right now in your refrigerator if you have eggs make little faces on the eggs

help oh no not me and maybe your mother or whoever opens the eggs will will feel

sad and feel bad and not cook eggs I have done this classic practical joke

somebody is sleeping you tickle their nose but before tickling your their nose

you put shaving cream on their hand so when they go to scratch their nose or

rub their nose they put shaving cream all over their

face so as you can see some jokes are prettyy funny and some

are going to really be painful that's it I hope you enjoyed an

introduction to some of the common practical jokes in America I'm sure

they're quite similar in your country if you have other ideas or other stories

please let us know

bye-bye
