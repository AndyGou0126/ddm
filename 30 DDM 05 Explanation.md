okay so you've done the dictation do you understand everything in these Seinfeld

scenes well the first scene once again George is moving back in with his

parents so George is humiliated he's very sad he's very

depressed his friends are bringing in all of his stuff his mother's offering

sandwiches it's very sweet but not it's kind of

frustrating yeah I feel sorry for George so let's look at a couple words

here suitcases luggage and stuff in this case they all mean the same thing but

actually suitcases are these so if you go on a trip you need a suitcase usually

one is enough but if you have a family you could have several suitcases or you

might get a set of luggage so the difference if there is a difference

between suitcases and Luggage suitcases are usually individual and luggages uh

luggage is a collection of several bags the same style the same company luggage

is usually a little bit more expensive than a suitcase in my case I only have a

suitcase I don't travel anywhere but when you're moving you might put some

clothes in suitcases or in luggage luggage is non-count is a non-count noun

uncountable but usually we use boxes and if you watch the scene there are many

boxes so box boxes luggage suitcase it's all stuff his personal

belongings remember George's mother does not laugh so Jerry wants to test Jerry

is a comedian he's a standup comedian so he's a funny guy so he has an idea to

make George's mom laugh so he wants to tell her a joke I got a terrific joke

for you I got a terrific joke I've got a great joke I have a wonderful joke I

have a funny joke I got a great story this is the idea now if you say I got a

terrific joke for you it better be funny it had better be funny so do you have a

joke for me I would love to hear a terrific joke so at the hangout on the

the Google Hangouts if you have a joke please tell me your terrific joke okay

I'm an easy laugher so if you tell me anything I might laugh why did the

chicken cross the road to get to the other

[Laughter] side yeah that's funny to me I don't

know why but I think that's

funny couch a couch is a sofa another word is

Davenport now I'm from Northern Wisconsin and where I live everybody

says couch but I have a friend who lived in Canada I don't think he's Canadian

but anyway he always says sofa he never says couch and my grandmother she's

passed away God rest your soul my grandmother she lived in near Chico

Chicago in the country area but near Chicago and she always said

Davenport it's the same thing so this is a couch typical couch has three cushions

or maybe two cushions this is a sectional couch you can pull the pieces

apart this is a love seat it's smaller than a couch and only two people can sit

there so in your living room you have several different types of furniture and

in the hangout I want you to describe the types of furniture you have in your

living room now my house is really small my house is so small I don't have a

living room yeah but I can describe my mother's living room my parents living

room so we can talk about living rooms and talk about the furniture in the

living rooms each piece of furniture has a special name so hopefully we can

figure out what it means okay okay Jerry starts to tell his joke

there's these two guys but I want you to focus on the

grammar there's these two guys is that correct no it's wrong there are these

two guys Jerry's an idiot no the message here is a lot of English students

they're afraid to speak because they might make a grammar mistake who cares

it's okay you can make grammar mistakes when you speak that's fine native

speakers we make mistakes Americans British people Irish people Australians

new zealanders whoever Canadians they make lots of mistakes and that's okay

okay perfect grammar is wonderful but as a student and even as a native speaker

when we're talking we make mistakes so don't worry about the mistakes in my

opinion pronunciation is much more important than grammar

mistakes baloney sandwiches now who can look at that word

and say baloney only Americans I think I don't

know Australia Canada Canada probably says baloney the UK I'm not sure now

some Americans do say bogna and some Americans say balona so you do have some

people with a more similar pronunciation but almost all Americans say baloney

baloney and actually when I was a kid there was a television commercial that

was so pop popular and so great let's sing the song together my baloney has a

first name o s c a r my baloney has a second name it's m a y e r oh I love to

eat it everything if you ask me while say cuz askar how the way with b o l o g

and a if the name's Oscar Meyer it's Quality Meat and no fillers just the

best that it can be isn't that great I really like that

commercial That's a classic commercial from like

1973 I don't know when I was just a little kid but baloney sandwiches that

is the ultimate lunch for kids in America a baloney sandwich maybe some

cheese maybe some lettuce but definitely some mayonnaise and or some mustard very

popular and then an apple and uh some milk or maybe some

juice that is the typical lunch maybe tomato soup but that is the typical

lunch for so many American kids when I was young absolutely and today still

it's very common but as we get older we eat less and less baloney most

of us and there's two reasons number one baloney is for kids it's a kids meal

number two actually it's not that healthy baloney is made from processed

meats that means they take meat and pork and whatever and they they scrape the

bone and they Mash all the meat together and then they make new meat and they add

lots of salt and nitrates it's actually not healthy at all okay so feeding it to

kids is probably a really terrible thing so to my son I don't give him processed

Meats another common processed meat is Spam and spam it tastes okay a lot of

people enjoy spam but it's a processed meat you probably shouldn't eat it

maybe there's healthy baloney I don't know but if you buy baloney in America

that looks like this yeah it's processed meat and it's probably not that good so

adults don't eat it that much nobody eats baloney and once again

George is referring to adults kids people of course eat baloney but the

older we get we don't eat it it's for kids and it's

unhealthy a little touched in the head a little touched in the head a little

crazy your elevator doesn't go to the top all the lights don't come on you're

a few cents short of a dollar these all mean the same thing you're a little bit

crazy you're not fully intelligent it's a great expression if you want to tell

somebody they're a little bit crazy you can say I think you're a little touched

in the head but don't say it to your mother or father they will probably be

angry unless they don't speak English then they won't know what you're saying

right handing out is a phrasal verb a two-word verb hand out to hand out

something means to give out something to distribute something thing so teachers

hand out homework they hand out tests sometimes in the city at lunchtime

people hand out coupons for coffee or for a a a lunch a coupon uh they give

you a coupon and you can get lunch for a cheaper price so to hand out something

all right in my life yes I've handed out business cards about my English classes

I handed them out on the streets of soul and nobody came I was so sad I spent a

lot of money too and a lot of time but anyway everybody's handing out something

and in this situation George's mother asks Jerry to

hand out baloney sandwiches in Jerry's building Jerry owns a building no no no

Jerry lives in an apartment building so the idea Jerry goes go home to his

apartment and he stands at the first floor hello my name is Jerry I live in

404 room 404 have a sandwich have a sandwich have that's crazy that that so

Jerry says I don't think I'd feel comfortable handing out baloney

sandwiches it would be uncomfortable for me I would feel

embarrassed would you feel comfortable handing out sandwiches or would you feel

uncomfortable a horn honks now in your car you have the steering wheel and

usually in the middle of the steering wheel you can push and you get that

sound so this device is a horn okay sometimes you have this kind of

horn yeah okay so that's a horn and the sound it makes is a honk so who honked

honk your horn okay make the honk sound with your

horn so Kramer was driving and moving George's stuff to George's house and his

car is on the street so he needs to move his car somebody needs to park or get by

and Kramer's car is blocking the way Kramer's car is in the way he is

impeding traffic so he's got to move his car he

has to move his car I have to go move my car I got to go move my

car Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend so

Jerry and his friend Elaine they're not a boyfriend girlfriend they're just

friends so Jerry and Elaine are double dating this is an expression we use

they're double dating with Kramer and his new girlfriend okay so Jerry and

Elaine on one side of the table and Kramer and his new girlfriend on the

other side that's a double date even though these two people aren't a

boyfriend and girlfriend two couples we can still say double date have you ever

been on a double date what do you think about going on a double date for your

first date is that a good idea or is that a a stupid idea if you have an

opinion write it out or let me know during the

hangout you can't believe this woman she's one of those low talkers you can't

believe this woman you wouldn't believe this woman this woman is

unbelievable now this woman is unbelievable it could be good it could

be bad this woman is unbelievable wow she's amazing she's so smart she knows

everything this woman is unbelievable she's terrible she's a

she's evil she's mean in my life I know some unbelievable

women like my mom and I know some unbelievable

women there's a couple at least at least there's one really unbelievable woman

really terrible so un you can't believe this woman could be good it could be bad

we don't know so Jerry says you can't believe this woman she's one of these

low talkers ah so This

Woman's characteristic is interesting it's unbelievable she is a low talker

what is a low talker well actually low talking to

somebody who talks like this somebody who talks like this it's uh it's well

it's the volume is low but also the uh the tone and and the projection it's

very low so it's I guess it's sometimes kind of difficult to hear and

understand yeah talking to a low talker did you

understand a low talker is somebody with no projection their voice doesn't go out

usually the tone is pretty low so it's very difficult to hear what they're

saying you have to watch their lips to really

understand now some of my YouTube fans I know are low talkers because we meet on

Google Hangout and I can hardly hear what you're saying maybe it's the

microphone or maybe you're embarrassed Jerry says you're always

going excuse me what's that you're always saying excuse me what's that

that's the idea instead of going we can say saying but what's interesting let's

say uh I said goodbye I went goodbye yes go past tense

went we can say it the same so uh if you if you meet the boss you have to go how

are you sir if you meet the boss you have to say how are you sir so I I met

the boss and I went how are you sir I met the boss and I said how are you sir

do you understand very common not just with speaking but also with signs the

stop sign said stop the stop the stop sign goes or or went stop the sign went

stop yeah it's possible some people will say

that take it easy take it easy if you're not using this expression start using it

it's a great expression and it means goodbye you can use it at the company to

your friends not really to the boss but to your same level or below uh you use

it with your friends do you use it to the family not really you could say it

to your mother that's okay but once again when you say goodbye to your

friends so in a Google hang out if we consider each other friends when we say

goodbye you can say take it easy take it easy get the pronunciation and smile

don't do this take it easy sounds kind of scary take it easy take it easy take

it easy staring off into space and buries

his face in his hands okay so staring off into space just means you're just

you're you're staring someplace but you're thinking you're not

looking you're thinking so you're staring off so even if somebody walks by

you don't really see them you're thinking this is when we say staring off

into space another expression zoning out zoning out so my eyes are open and

they're looking but I'm not seeing anything

so sometimes if people drink too much or if they take drugs they can be zoned

out or staring off into space now the next one he George buries

his face in his hands so Berry or Buri or I'm sorry bu bu some people say bu

and some people say Berry I say Berry so he buries his face bury usually means to

dig a hole and put it in the whole that's the idea buries his

face in his hands in his hands bury your chin in your palms in your palms these

are your palms so this is your hand oh my God these are your palms uh I'm bored

that's the idea I don't think we say too many other situations bury your face in

your hands oh it's terrible embarrassing

bury your chin in your palms and that would be like that got

it so the next scene George and his mother and father go to a restaurant and

the mother is nagging George you should get a job you should take the civil

service exam now the civil service test or civil service exam this is basically

the government test to become a government employee so if

you want to be the CIA the FBI the state department the post office the county

office the city hall or whatever if you want a federal job a government job you

need to take the civil service exam some of them are difficult there are many

different types of exams uh I haven't taken one so I don't know how difficult

or easy it is I do know that in Korea to get to pass the test is actually very

difficult but if you get a government job you never get fired that's

cool salt shaker now on a table and let's think about a restaurant if you go

to a restaurant on the table there are several things there's the salt shaker

you the salt and you shake and salt comes out there's the pepper shaker so

you got salt and pepper these are called condiments

condiments okay I want to know what other kinds of condiments are common in

your house or at your favorite restaurant uh for me at the restaurant I

go to there's salt and pepper and there's ketchup and mustard and I think

that's it but different restaurants have

different condiments and different countries have different condiments here

are some typical condiments in America the salt shaker the pepper for pepper

shaker ketchup a ketchup bottle squeeze bottle and of course mustard M this is

salsa salsa sauce it's very popular it's growing in popularity in

America sometimes you'll see guacamole guacamole this is made from avocado very

popular in Mexican food and uh what what else is there do you have a special

condiment in your country o I know in Japan they have a special condiment do

you know there's actually two I can think of two special condiments in Japan

what about your country tell me about a popular

condiment a silver dollar it's a $1 coin now he's talking about silver dollars

and the last silver dollars made or we say minted in America was back in

1935 and those silver dollarss were called

Peace dollars and those silver dollars were actually made of silver and it's a

$1 coin but today if you melted it to just silver it's worth

$28 2800% that's

great and then they stopped making silver dollars until 1971 one and from

1971 to 1976 they made Eisenhower dollars that's

a picture of President Eisenhower or we also call him Ike now there was only 40%

silver in an Eisenhower dollar but that dollar if you melted it and took out the

silver is worth $9 a 900% gain so if you or your dad or

your grandpa or your mom or your aunt has a silver dollar with a picture of

Ike from 1971 to 1976 keep it or sell it it's worth

$9 if you have an old one it's worth a lot of money it's worth

more than $28 uh but anyway this is the idea of

the silver dollar so now noways they still make a dollar coin and people call

it a silver dollar but it's not a silver dollar it's made of copper and other

metals no silver no gold it's it's just a piece of metal that says a dollar that

doesn't really mean anything yeah collection a lot of students want

to say collection but we don't it's collection

collection there are many types of collections when I was young I had

several collections I had a bottle cap collection beer caps here's a picture

and I also had a beer can collection many different types of beer

cans and I didn't drink the beer I just had the collection I had a stamp

collection ction actually my stamp collection was very amazing my

grandfather's helped me build my stamp collection I had a very small coin

collection and I had some very valuable good coins too I wonder if my mom or my

sister still has them if they do I should get them back it's worth lots of

money I also had a baseball card collection and a football card

collection and an NBA card collection so I had a

lot of collections when I was a little kid what about you what kind of

collections did you have I'm sure you had a collection tell us about it what

did you collect was it worth any money do you still have the collection what

happened to the collection if you don't have

it job security and a paycheck every week a

paycheck every week the US government pays every week well actually I think

the government pays every two weeks on the 15th and the 30th of every month I

think or maybe it's the 14th and the 28th something like that so what about

in your country does the government pay once a month or twice a month in America

it's twice a month that's kind of cool most jobs just pay once a month so job

security Now job security is a great expression and that's the idea of

Communism once you get a job you'll have that job forever the you you it's you

never get fired and America's not communist but an American government job

is like communism once you get an American government job you never get

fired you're secure you're safe you don't work much you read the newspaper

you work from 9 to 5: but actually you don't do any work you have a long lunch

you take naps you're rude to people this is a government job in

America what a great job you can hate people not do any work never get fired

and you get paid twice a month that sounds like

heaven doesn't sound bad right yeah I couldn't bring myself to this is

a great expression a great pattern I couldn't bring myself to do something

and the Nuance is you you wanted to do something but ah you couldn't find the

energy you couldn't find the passion you couldn't find the guts The Bravery the

boldness you you grew weak so I couldn't bring

myself to break up with my girlfriend I couldn't bring myself to tell the boss I

will not work on weekends I couldn't bring myself to

refuse the alcoholic beverage I couldn't bring myself to wake up early in the

morning H I just couldn't do it I was weak I was weak weak in that moment

okay phobia yes many people have phobia a

phobia or phobias I have a phobia about Heights I'm afraid of

heights what about you do you have a phobia the word phobia is actually I

think it's Greek and it's we use it for in Psychology so a

Arachnophobia is the fear of spiders claustrophobia is the fear of type

places okay there are many types of phobias do you have a

phobia I do know I have some kind of a talent something to offer I just don't

know what it is so George says I know I do know he could just say I know why

does he say do to emphasize he really does know I do know that I have some

kind of a talent I have something to offer

people but he doesn't know what it is for

me I wanted to be a business person I wanted to do trading international

trading and making contracts and stuff like that but when I was was about 30

years old I realized my talent is not in business my talent is in education in

teaching in teaching English or coaching English so I decided when I was 30 okay

I'm G to focus on English education I found my talent to help

people George is still looking for his talent but he knows he has one he just

hasn't found it yet have you found your talent to help people once again in the

hangout tell us what your talent is to do a magic trick he does a magic

trick so that's the verb we use when we talk about magic tricks can you do a

magic trick have you ever done a magic trick h H if you can do a magic trick

and you can show us on YouTube at the hangout then I really want to see your

magic trick otherwise just shoot a video of you doing your magic trick and upload

it to your YouTube channel that would be cool if you're at a restaurant in

America and probably your country too how do you call the waiter or the

waitress in Korea you just say cho

cho or some people say Yogo Yogo and that is it's what what the

words are Choo is there Yogo is here there here so you can say that in

Korea but in America usually what we do is we

just we raise our hand and we wait for eye contact and then and that's it some

people in America especially if you're in a bad mood or if you're in a hurry or

if the waiter doesn't look at you they do

this hey hey hey hey hey don't say anything but they they snap their

fingers I really don't recommend snapping your fingers that's

really bad okay so once again I don't know what tell me about in your country

how do you call the waiter or the waitress but in America be patient and

just raise your hand don't do this that's that would be in school just

just this okay this is enough and look and somebody should come to your

table not at McDonald's okay nobody's going to help you at McDonald's at a

nice restaurant even at a restaurant like Pizza Hut that's

enough oh I'm sorry I'm terribly sorry memorize this expression it's a great

expression if you make some sort of social error just say oh I'm terribly

sorry I'm terribly sorry I'm very sorry that's fine I'm very sorry is great but

terribly has a really strong meaning and it's a great expression oh I'm terribly

sorry oh my good did I step on your foot I'm terribly sorry sorry oh are you okay

oh I'm terribly did you spill your coffee because oh I'm terribly sorry

here here's $100 you've spilled my bag you've

spilled my coffee you made me drop my bag you made me drop my books you ripped

my newspaper you did something look what you did look what you have done look

what you've done look what you did you are

responsible stuttering means this sometimes when when you're

really like scared or nervous or really cold you

stutter this is

stuttering to tell you the truth I don't think to tell you the truth I don't

think now to tell you the truth means actually actually I don't think in my

opinion I don't think that's what it means and usually it's negative to tell

you the truth it was easy that's posit that's that's possible okay but I would

say generally it's negative to tell you the truth once again other people might

not know but actually in my opinion that's when we say to tell you the truth

so your mother brings some food this is my new soup how do you like it oh mother

this soup is delicious mother you're the best

cook and then to your wife to tell you the truth it's terrible can I have some

more to tell you the truth to tell you the truth get the pronunciation to tell

you the truth I hate it to tell you the truth I don't like it

hand modeling have you ever heard of hand

modeling do you know somebody who is a hand

model what does a hand model do oh I guess if you're selling a watch you need

a hand model they only take a picture of this or maybe selling a ring you need a

hand model or ladies you have your nail polish your

manicure that would be a hand model so if you're a hand model that probably

means you're really ugly oh the hand is beautiful and that's

George George he's a balding fat guy who has beautiful hands

he's a hand model wow George is a

model do you think I could be a model what kind of model model could I

be I could be an armpit model yes an underarm model for deodorant just take a

picture here yes I have a very nice armpit I won't show you you have to pay

money to see my armpit I could be an armpit

model shakes his head no shakes his head yes it's possible but

usually we say nod n o d nods his head yes shakes his head no shrugs his

shoulders what does this mean this means I don't know yes

no shake nod shrug shrug got

it and the last thing I wanted to talk about was here's my card here's my

business card some people say business card just say here's my card do not say

here's my name card because a name card is

this so you're at uh an expo an exposition a conference and my name is
